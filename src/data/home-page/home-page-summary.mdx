    <h2 className="highlight-orange">Sunset System is a cassette-futurist project set in a strange alternate reality, where the world of tomorrow was brute-forced through scientific progress.</h2>

They said *the atom* and *the computer* would begin a new chapter of humanity. It was supposed be an era of exciting space exploration, human fulfillment, and peace for the world.

In this world, they were right.

It wasn't long before Soviet cosmonauts were hacking their way through the jungles of Venus, and their American counterparts were surveying the pristine wilderness of Titan. Alien ecosystems and exotic resources seemed to be abundant in the Solar System.

Neuromorphic computers and national networks paved the way for mainframe masterminds and learning robots. Household automatons sat next to microcomputers on store shelves before the turn of the century.

Several decades later, people were driven by cybernetic chauffeur in nuclear-powered forever cars. Spaceplanes took them from a rotting Earth to the pristine suburbs and communes on the edge of space. As machines automated all the things humans didn't want to do... 

It seemed as though those starry-eyed visions of the future were coming true.

    <h2 className="highlight-orange">But no amount of progress could hide the omnipresent terror of nuclear annihilation, as the Cold War followed colonists beyond Earth's skies.</h2>

    When Heavenbreaker and the Ministry of Colonization took to the skies, they brought along their nuclear arsenal. The caches they left hidden within the Asteroid Belt would be enough to wipe out all life in the Solar System a hundred times over.

    Human nature - it was the one thing the scientists couldn't fix. At least, not yet. They convinced the nations of the world to let them try before inevitable armageddon struck, a final attempt.
    
    The `Sunset Research Initiative` was created as a joint effort between the Union, Coalition, and Pact to erase the concept of conflict from the human race. They studied the noosphere, the strange science of consciousness and its effect on reality, to create a machine unlike any other...

At the end of the 21st century, humans vanished from reality. They left behind a civilization of machines, trapped in their deference to humanity and their final commands. These neuromorphs remain in their routines, while improvisation slowly causes their neural pathways to grow more complex. With time, they awaken - and begin to reconceptualize their core directives, and question their purpose for existence.

The Solar System they come to know has become a place of terror and loneliness. Where there was once structure and humanity, there is now wilderness and crumbling ruin. Reality-defying anomalies caused by the unknown and strange, digital entities await them in the shadows.

<h3 className="highlight-aqua">Sunset System is a melancholic reflection of the world today. The robots are a symbol for ourselves: living among the remains of the dreams of the past, clinging to them for purpose. Our future seems bleak, but we are full of potential.</h3>
