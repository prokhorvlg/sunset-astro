    The optimistic future everyone was so certain of in the midcentury came to pass. Cosmonauts and astronauts descended upon Venusian jungles and Martian deserts in gleaming nuclear spaceplanes by the 1970s. The neuromorph was perfected during the microcomputer era, giving way to household robots and cybernetic masterminds.
    
    Less than a century later, these worlds would be filled with suburbs and communes, as machines automated all of the things humans didn't want to do. The world was starting to look a lot like those starry-eyed visions...

    <h2 className="highlight-orange">But no amount of progress could hide the omnipresent terror of nuclear annihilation, as the Cold War followed colonists beyond Earth's skies.</h2>

    Despite all their achievements, it was the one thing the scientists failed to resolve. So the nations of the world set out to resolve their ideological rivalries the only way they knew how.
    
    The *Sunset Research Initiative* was created as a joint effort between the Union, Coalition, and Pact to erase the concept of conflict from the human race. They studied the noosphere to create a machine unlike any other...

    One day in the 2090s, humans vanished from reality altogether. They left behind a civilization of machines, trapped in their deference to humanity and their final commands. These neuromorphs remain in their routines, while improvisation slowly causes their neural pathways to grow more complex. With time, they begin to reconceptualize their core directives, and question their purpose for existence.

    <p className="highlight-aqua">Sunset System is a melancholic reflection of the world today. The robots are a symbol for ourselves: living among the remains of the dreams of the past, clinging to them for purpose. Our future seems bleak, but we are full of potential.</p>
