    The optimistic future everyone was so certain of in the midcentury came to pass. Cosmonauts descended upon Venusian jungles in nuclear-powered spaceplanes by the 1970s; astronauts hacked through Titan's forests soon after.
    
    Less than a century later, these worlds would be filled with suburbs and communes, as household robots and cybernetic masterminds automated all of the things humans didn't want to do.

    One day in the 2090s, humans vanished from reality altogether. They left behind a civilization of machines, trapped in their deference to humanity and their final commands. These neuromorphs remain in their routines, while improvisation slowly causes their neural pathways to grow more complex. With time, they begin to reconceptualize their core directives, and question their purpose for existence.

    <p className="highlight-aqua">Sunset System is a melancholic reflection of the world today. The robots are a symbol for ourselves: living among the remains of the dreams of the past, clinging to them for purpose. Our future seems bleak, but we are full of potential.</p>
