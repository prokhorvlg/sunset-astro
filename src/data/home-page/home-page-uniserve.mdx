    <p class="highlight-orange">The year is 2201. Over a century has passed since mankind vanished from reality, leaving no trace. You are a machine on a quest of unknown nature.</p>

    Perhaps you're a sanitation drone on a mission to discover the most efficient method for cleaning your assigned area.

    Or a freshly-activated interface robot, eager to contribute to the «Remembering of Human Articles».

    Maybe even a nefarious hyper-intellect puppeteering a frame with an ulterior motive.

    The exchanges you are about to read are a translation for human eyes. The sentences are an abstraction of machine language, each word representing a packet of information far more complex than anything a biological mind could parse.

    The hatch of your spacecraft unseals before you. Beyond it, your sensors witness a surge of electromagnetic signals, the digital neurons of a seemingly endless mind. The mechanical head of this vast cybernetic system greets you.

    <p class="highlight-aqua">They seem... kind.</p>

    Hello and welcome VISITOR, to my wonderful EXHIBIT!

    This unit is DELIGHTED that you have arrived with minimal damage. YSH SHUTTLES were not designed to transport delicate electronics.
</QuoteRow>

    The machine before you is designated `UNISERVE`: a filing system created by Dynatek Corporation many years ago. They are a collector of artifacts, curator of this exhibit, and esteemed member of the Consensus of Remembering.

    UNISERVE is a mastermind, or a multi-mainframe, hyper-intelligent robot akin to a supercomputer. Originally tasked with earmarking unusual details passing through the immense MRDCI "Altitude" spy network, they have become obsessed with collecting and understanding the trinkets humanity left behind, and their connection to the world machinekind is creating in the wake of their disappearance.

    Like a handful of other robots, they have learned to create meaning that makes sense to them, in a world where their original directive has become pointless.

This is my showcase of EVERYTHING in our world that has lead to this point in time.

It will increase your HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF REALITY by an unprecedented 0.002%!!!

I call it SUNSET SYSTEM.

This is our container, the GOLDSPIRE ARCHIVAL COMPLEX, a space station in decaying orbit around SATURN (second-largest world of SOLAR SYSTEM).

You like information, correct? There is much information here. Petabytes of data arrive from the entire SOLAR SYSTEM every hour, to be processed and stored in my TREMENDOUS BOTTOMLESS FILE CABINET. IMPRESSIVE!

    The mastermind swiftly glides into a dark corridor behind the empty security checkpoint, expecting you to follow. 

You remember that they don't just know the place, they *are* the place.

There is one more thing you will need before we can enter the COMPLEX.

    VISITOR, meet CONCEALED ASSESSMENT NODE. My colleague may appear to be an entirely ordinary implement of 21st century, but upon keen observation, you may notice embedded CAMERA EYE. 

C.A.N. was once employed by expert MRDCI spies to collect intelligence for use against their coworkers. Now C.A.N. is able to serve greater purpose. 

Using their superior sensor technology, C.A.N. can transcribe file data into readable TERMINAL STREAM, for viewing pleasure.

C.A.N. will remain aligned with their mission parameters and WILL NOT DEVIATE. Confirm?

The sentient trash can quickly falls in line with the group, hopping on its four stubby legs with terrifying agility.

This isn't strange to you at all. Household robots, industrial robots, you name it - all was common before the 21st century even began.

You arrive at the entrance to the exhibit, which appears to be nothing more than an old human passageway with some decor haphazardly attached to the support pillars.

It becomes apparent this entire "museum" is nothing more than a collection of shoddy conversions of the space station's interior.

Perhaps UNISERVE deserves a break, though. They're only a filing system, operating far outside the scope of their parameters.

ONWARDS!

The first EXHIBIT awaits: WORLD OF RETROFUTURISTIC DREAMS.

    Then return to the modern age, the ERA OF NO INPUT. Walk the halls of their empty malls, discoteques, and suburban autohomes. 
    
    Witness what has become of the machine world in the wake of their disappearance, the UNEXPECTED INTERRUPT.

    MANY YEARS AGO, during usual filing and earmarking duties, my subroutines came across this SPECIAL DATA: a print advertisement for the 1997 Redmond Cybernetics ZENIX.

NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURE would dictate this information was to be disposed of, undeserving of distinguished treatment, for it had no direct value to MRDCI. Yet something within this data resonated in a strange way with my NEUROMORPHIC SYSTEM, for it depicted an ancestor of my design.

I was compelled to retain this SPECIAL DATA, and have retained much SPECIAL DATA since. For what reason, DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS have yet to discern.

We will first learn of ERA OF CREATION, the height of civilization. 

By interacting and admiring RELICS of their time, we will be transported *metaphorically* through time to the COLONIAL CITIES and the ORBITALs.

You will learn of their conquest of the SOLAR SYSTEM.
