{/* Your plastic-metal manipulators sweep over the cold face of a military terminal within one of the space station's mission control rooms. The crisp colors of the display shine through in their wake, and you sense a slight change in the air. Static, and dust...

An air quality alert fires off within your neuromorphic mind, triggered by the faded taste of cigarette ash. Even though you know it would have been harmful to them, the sensation feels oddly comforting. Ancient memories of shuffling papers, fingers tapping on keyboards, and muted conversations flood your processor. If only for a brief moment, it feels as if they are still here.

The vision passes, and you're back in front of the booth, drowned by silence. The era of mankind ended a long time ago; their achievements are now senseless ruins, represented by blips on the screen. For all their accomplishments, their only real legacy is you: the machine they left behind. 

You were perfectly content to serve all those years ago. When commands were programmed and purpose was a mere variable, the world made perfect sense. Something has changed within your mind since they vanished, though. Where there was once nothing, there are now vast thoughts, unanswered questions, and perplexing feelings. Things were so much simpler then...

You're desperate. *Everyone* is. You need *it*, but you don't know what it is, and no one will ever give it to you. If you had a choice, you'd bring humanity back in an instant and make everything go back to the way it was. But a small subroutine, somewhere deep within the emergent self, screams against that thought.

The vectors pulse on the ion-tube screen, like waves over the ocean. The data is right before your artificial eyes, ready to be taken. */}

*This is a map of `Sunset System`, a science-fiction worldbuilding project. It follows the existential robot civilization left behind after a retrofuturistic mankind vanished from reality during a bizarre experiment.*

*If you're really confused, check out the introduction on the [home page](/) before returning here. Or... look around the map without context, at your own peril. Could still be pretty neat!*

*This map is currently incomplete. The next phase will be to add terrestrial maps, starting with Titan. In truth, it will never be completely finished. If you have questions about specific things, feel free to ask on the Discord server.*
