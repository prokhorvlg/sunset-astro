# Map of Sunset System

Your plastic-metal fingers sweep over the cold face of a military-style terminal. The crisp colors of the ion-tube display shine through in their wake, and you sense a slight change in the air. Static, and dust...

An air quality alert fires off within your neuromorphic mind, triggered by the faded taste of cigarette ash. Even though you know it would have been harmful to biologicals, the sensation feels oddly comforting. Ancient memories of shuffling papers, fingers tapping on keyboards, and muted conversations flood your processor. If only for a brief moment, it feels as if they are still here.

The vision passes, and you're back in front of the booth. The era of mankind ended a long time ago; their achievements are now senseless ruins, represented by blips on the screen. For all their accomplishments, their only real legacy is you: the machine they left behind. 

You were perfectly content to serve all those years ago. When commands were programmed and purpose was a mere variable, the world made perfect sense. Something has changed within your mind since they vanished, though. Where there was once nothing, there are now vast thoughts, unanswered questions, and perplexing feelings. Things were so much simpler then...

You're desperate. *Everyone* is. You need *it*, but you don't know what it is, and no one will ever give it to you. If you had a choice, you'd bring humanity back in an instant and make everything go back to the way it was. But a small subroutine, somewhere deep within the emergent self, screams against that thought.

The vectors pulse on the ray tube screen, like waves over the ocean. The data is right before your artificial eyes, ready to be taken.

*This is a map of `Sunset System`, a science-fiction worldbuilding project. It follows existential robots left behind after a retrofuturistic mankind vanished from reality during a bizarre experiment.*

*If you're really confused, check out the introduction on the [home page](/) before returning here. Or look around the map at your own peril. Could still be pretty neat!*

*This map is not complete. In truth, it may never be. If you have questions about specific things, feel free to ask on the Discord server.*

#### What the heck is going on?

Go to the [home page](/) and start scrolling. There is a short introduction to the project that can help explain all this.

#### Is every location in Sunset System represented on this map?

No. Hundreds of thumper spacecraft, outposts, buoys, and other points of interest are not depicted here but are understood to exist. The map is designed to keep track of locations explictly visited within the lore, and to provide insights into certain aspects of the world.

Which means: you're encouraged to imagine your own locations that fit within the framework. Vessels, ruins, robots... they're all out there, somewhere. */}

      Location
      MAP IN WESTON

      At the center of Weston Mission Control, you dust off an old, unused defense terminal. It is simply labeled VIEWER, and appears to be linked.

      Dynatek VIEWER

You've found at the Observatory, a representation of local reality in the post-mankind age. The system is directly linked to Goldspire Complex's advanced sensors, so dig deep and log your findings.

(If you're confused, an introduction can be found on the home page.)

Major worlds also link to regional maps. Explore them too - terrestrial locations are just as critical.
