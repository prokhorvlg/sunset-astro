You step into a navigation booth within Weston Mission Control. The rusty, military-style terminal is linked to the internal database of Goldspire.

      Immediately, an air quality alert fires off within your neuromorphic mind, triggered by the faded taste of cigarette smoke. Even though you know it would have been harmful to biologicals, the sensation feels oddly comforting. Ancient memories of shuffling papers, fingers tapping on keyboards, and muted conversations flood your processor. 

      If only for a fleeting moment, it feels as if they were still here.

      The vision passes, and you're back in the booth. The era of mankind ended a long time ago; their achievements are all ruins, represented by the blips on the screen in front of you. The only ones remaining to admire their legacy are machines like you, built to serve them all those years ago.

      The vectors pulse on the ray tube screen, like waves over the ocean. The data is right before your artificial eyes, ready to be taken.
