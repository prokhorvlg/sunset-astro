# Map of Sunset System

You step into a navigation booth within Weston Mission Control. The rusty, military-style terminal is linked to the internal database of Goldspire.

Immediately, an air quality alert fires off within your neuromorphic mind, triggered by the faded taste of cigarette smoke. Even though you know it would have been harmful to biologicals, the sensation feels oddly comforting. Ancient memories of shuffling papers, fingers tapping on keyboards, and muted conversations flood your processor.

If only for a fleeting moment, it feels as if they were still here.

The vision passes, and you're back in the booth. The era of mankind ended a long time ago; their achievements are all ruins, represented by the blips on the screen in front of you. The only ones remaining to admire their legacy are machines like you, built to serve them all those years ago.

The vectors pulse on the ray tube screen, like waves over the ocean. The data is right before your artificial eyes, ready to be taken.

Is every location in Sunset System on this map?

No. Hundreds of thumper spacecraft, outposts, buoys, and other points of interest not depicted here but are understood to exist. The map is designed to keep track of locations explictly visited within the lore, and to provide insights into certain aspects of the world.

Which means: you're encouraged to imagine your own locations that fit within the framework. Vessels, ruins, robots... they're all out there, somewhere.

      Location
      MAP IN WESTON

      At the center of Weston Mission Control, you dust off an old, unused defense terminal. It is simply labeled VIEWER, and appears to be linked.

      Dynatek VIEWER

You've found at the Observatory, a representation of local reality in the post-mankind age. The system is directly linked to Goldspire Complex's advanced sensors, so dig deep and log your findings.

(If you're confused, an introduction can be found on the home page.)

Major worlds also link to regional maps. Explore them too - terrestrial locations are just as critical.
