Colonized in the 2000s by both the Americans and Soviets, Mercury is known for little more than hosting an extensive mining operation. A significant portion of the world has been processed by the current day, leading to a clear "missing chunk" of the planet.

There is very little of interest on the surface. One of the few notable regions is `ZONA D-88`, a mining site designated by the Union sometime in the 2000s. It is home to a critical Sunset Research Initiative outpost.
