Named for the five private-venture orbitals it was assembled from, the `Gemini Five` is a Coalition orbital in close proximity to Saturn. It was sometimes referred to as `the Stack` or `the Kebab` for its design, in which the constituent space stations were attached end to end at their respective centers to form the vessel that is Gemini.

With over 180,000 inhabitants and many more transient visitors, Gemini was a fully fledged orbital city and military base, best known for its extensive industrial and zero-g manufacturing sector. It was here that most of Titan's `tetradite ore` was refined into alloy and assembled or traded on the international market.

#### Origins as private ventures

In the late 20th century, a significant number of ring-style habitat rings were built and deployed across the System by various private organizations. Only some of these became successful. Eventually, humans would learn that a venture has a better chance of working out if it's either *very small* and relies on a temporary crew, or *very large* with a permanent population and a wide assortment of services and amenities. 

It's not that medium-scale stations, with populations of tens of thousands of occupants, were inherently failures. They just rarely seemed to work out from a cost-risk perspective.

Gemini Five was the Coalition's way to test this hypothesis, a response to the Union's rapid construction of Gorsk Orbital out near Jupiter, and a quick solution to the massive amounts of tetradite alloy beginning to lift off from Titan's surface mining operations. As part of the program, `Heavenbreaker` - the Coalition's space administration - purchased five existing medium-scaled stations, hauled them to Saturn, and connected them using a specialized superstructure.

- `Steinbek Industrial Hexhab`, a ring designed and built for the industrial exploitation of the Phaeton Belt.
- `Edwin Hall Drum`, a large habitat designed as an "orbital hotel". Once the novelty of space began to lessen in favor of trips to other worlds, the Hall became a failing business.
- `Mokumokuren Monitor Platform`, a sphere station created by a pre-Pact corporation to study Venusian plant growth, but fell on the wrong side of the Union.
- `Aakash Research System`, a spinning arm hab built to study Saturn and the outer System.
- `Orbital Dynamics E1 Ferz`, a large cylinder designed to mine and exploit Saturn rings.

#### Prosperity and stability

With the constituent stations integrated and redesigned over the next decade, Gemini Five's population grew to fill the industrial and technology needs of the Outer System, and it took on its final role as "the factory in the sky". The station became far more successful than its constituents ever would have been, outputting almost half of all tetradite alloys used in robots by the end of the 21st century. Coalition officials hailed Gemini as a shining example of the glories of private venture; ironic, given the vessel was the direct result of their intervention.

As millions flocked from Earth to Titan's growing cities and suburbs, the stations's growth slowed down, with all attention now on the living world underneath. By the 2070s, mass immigration was essentially over, major businesses had institutionalized, and the culture had settled down. Symbolically, the torch passed as the central stock exchange was transferred to New Providence in 2074.

Still, the Kebab remained. Its industrious, notoriously hard-edged population of spacers had no intention of leaving. Go `Gemini Spinners`!

That's their BASKETBALL team. Football and baseball were challenging to play with cramped fields and CORIOLIS EFFECT, so... they were pretty bad at those.
