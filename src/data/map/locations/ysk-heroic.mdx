The `YSK Courageous` is one of several dozen Voronin-class nuclear-pulse vessels operated by the Union's Ministry of Colonization. 

Unlike dawnframe-style vessels designed as fully-fledged mobile spaceports and military bases, the Courageous is a `boomer`: a thumper designed primarily to haul around a payload of nuclear warheads and other weapons, though somewhat dated by the time of the Unexpected Interrupt. The role of boomers gradually fell away in favor of sleeper missiles, automated spacecraft similar to ballistic missiles, but stashed in deep space.

Regardless, the Courageous remains on patrol. Its supply of nuclear bombs is continuously replenished by the robust military infrastructure being restored by the Consensus of Order. Though it is considered a nuclear threat to the stability of the System, its automated crew appear to remain aligned with the machine world's interests.

The Courageous is the original home of `ROSTAM`, one of the few spaceplane navigator systems to have been decorated as an Honored Robot of the USSR. They seek a way to replace the Courageous's nuclear pulse drive with a less destructive propulsion system, but until then, ROSTAM has been assisting Goldspire with the procurement of artifacts from across the System.
