Superguns such as the `Slingshot` are a common sight across the System for a simple reason: there's a lot of stuff to push around, and a gun is the cheapest and most reliable to do it. Also known as "cargo railguns", most superguns are designed to launch parcels on slow trajectories to locations elsewhere in the System. In the case of the Slingshot and similar installations in the Phaeston Belt, they launch refined resources to distant facilities. Some parcels can even land in terrestrial locations on their own.

Superguns are also incredibly versatile. Most are just electromagnetic railguns compatible with anything that fits into a weapon armature. This means they are effective military installations: superguns can participate in defense operations against thumper spacecraft, rocket-powered shipping frames, other space stations, and sleeper missiles. This also means superguns are almost always military-controlled. The Slingshot, for example, is operated by the `Heavenbreaker Initiative`, the military-expeditionary force of the Coalition.

Some superguns are spaceborne, like this one, but that isn't always the case. More than a few are terrestrial installations, designed to launch parcels into orbit from a planet's surface. Though very different in design, these terrestrial cousin fulfill a near identical role as cargo launching and defensive positions.
