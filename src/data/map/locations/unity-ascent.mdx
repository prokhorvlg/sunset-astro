The `Unity Ascent` is a large skyscraper-styled vessel which was observed over Callisto for the first time after the Unexpected Interrupt, and has since periodically appeared across the Solar System, mostly in the Jovian region. 

Little is known about the vessel and its occupants, as it seems to actively avoid contact at any cost. Few things are certain.

- `Human-Designed`: The Unity Ascent is a spacecraft designed for human beings, but they appear to be gone, as the craft has only exibited evidence of machine behavior.

- `Starscraper Design`: The vessel's design does not correspond to any of those produced by the major powers. It is styled as a full-glass skyscraper. The material science required to do this was not available during mankind's time. 

- `Advanced Propulsion`: The vessel is not nuclear-pulsed. Instead, it appears to rely on some kind of fusion-based drive, also beyond mankind's technological capabilities.

Unity Ascent is categorized as an unknown/risk by the Consensus of Order, the machine collective seeking to stabilize the System, but few actions have been taken to neutralize or capture it. At this time, the vessel does not seem to pose as much of a threat as nuclear armaments and viral entities.
