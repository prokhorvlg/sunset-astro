`Europa`, the tropical ocean world, is Jupiter's largest moon and most viable target for human colonization within the Jovian system. With its comfortable temperatures and pleasant atmosphere, it was considered a paradisal destination. Its oceans are deep and seemingly endless, with danger increasing with each fathom.

Though more heavily colonized by the Union, most nations had a presence here of some sort. Its largest settlement was the city of `Gao`, a large mass of floating modules anchored to the sea floor. Initially founded as a research colony studying the radiation-resistant life forms of Europa, the complex eventually grew to handle a significant portion of the System's pharmaceutical industry. The city was was renown for its universities and pseudo-beach resorts; though almost anywhere on the surface is a decent place to touch down for a cheap stay, as long as its not over an ice cap, algae tract, or whirlstorm.

Construction on Europa was very unique, as each large structure is a prefabricated module constructed elsewhere in the System landed on the ocean's surface.
