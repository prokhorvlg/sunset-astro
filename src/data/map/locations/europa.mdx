`Europa`, the tropical ocean world, is Jupiter's largest moon and most viable target for human colonization within the Jovian system. With its comfortable temperatures and pleasant atmosphere, it was considered a paradisal destination. Europa's oceans are deep and seemingly endless, with danger increasing with each fathom.

Though more heavily colonized by the Union, most nations had a presence here of some sort. Its largest settlement was the city of `Gao`, a mass of floating modules anchored to the sea floor. Initially founded as a research colony studying the radiation-resistant life forms of Europa, the complex eventually grew to handle a significant portion of the System's pharmaceutical industry. The city was was renown for its universities and pseudo-beach resorts; though almost anywhere on the surface is a decent place to touch down for a cheap stay, as long as its not over an ice cap, algae tract, or whirlstorm.

Construction on Europa was very unique, as each large structure is a prefabricated module constructed elsewhere in the System landed on the ocean's surface. In many cases, these modules were designed to operate at below-surface levels, and were artificially submerged beneath sea level. A few facilities were constructed at shallow ocean floors, though these were rare.

#### Deep ocean

The deeper levels of the ocean were explored extensively for the purpose of harvesting of alien life, which was useful in pharmaceutical development and genetic engineering. Even so, they remain fairly unknown.

These levels harbor the `al'kawat`, a large predator that uses organic turbines to traverse at incredible speed. These creatures collapse into the shape of a bullet in transit, and unfold into a squid-like form to grab and squeeze their prey. These were responsible for many expedition failures, including the well-known 2003 crushing of the Volga, a disaster that took 86 lives.

Large sections of the lower ocean also appear to be much warmer than expected, and may be responsibly for the world's comfortable living temperatures. These are assumed to be geothermal vents, though geologists have noted inconsistencies with those found on other worlds. None of these vents have ever been discovered.
