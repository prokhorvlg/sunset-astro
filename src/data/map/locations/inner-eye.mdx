The `Inner Eye` resides within one of the many spacetime tears and folds of the broken space surrounding it. The structure isn't the largest orbital to exist; far from it actually, but it is perhaps the most magnificent of them. The vehicle was designed to accomodate about 50,000 crew, the majority of which would have been researchers, and house the largest noetic system ever produced by human hands: `Project WHITE SERAPH`, the creator of a new world.

#### Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair

There have been millions of attempts to access the Inner Eye in the century since mankind's disappearance. Most of these have been by constituents of the `Consensus of a Dream`, the machine collective which sought to learn the true fate of mankind, though the efforts have waned over time as they always seems to result in death. Or... perhaps not death, but no one who wanders into the collapsed reality seems to return, which is considered a failure of core directive.

All the machine world has to operate from are ancient documents and specifications, most of which have seemingly been eradicated or safeguarded by a vicious digital entity known as the `Erasure`. It is widely known that the device within was activated by the Sunset Research Initiative on Unity Day, the scheduled end of all of mankind's troubles with violence and self-destruction. It may be better recognized as the Unexpected Interrupt, the day mankind vanished... May 5, 2095. 

It is pretty clear that the device's activation went differently than expected.

#### Origins as Vulcan Joint Venture

Design of the structure began in the late 20th century as the second collaboration between the American and Soviet space programs. Construction of the vessel began soon after the completion of Prometheus, which remains around Mars today. The project would be named `Vulcan`: a new, improved design that removed the issues present in Prometheus. The split-design origin of Inner Eye can be traced back to these early days. 

Midway through the construction of Vulcan, a number of military escalations and political incidents elsewhere lead to a temporary pause in the process. As relations between the Greater Union and Enduring Coalition soured once again, as they always eventually did, this pause became indefinite, leaving a half-complete megastructure vacant in Mercury orbit.

For half a century, the shell sat incomplete over Mercury, silently reminding mankind of is political reality. Though incomplete, its reactor was fully functional and the system remained in orbit. As it was never sealed and pressurized, Vulcan became a popular destination for interplanetary criminals and black operatives, who slipped deep into the structure when the occasional patrol frame passed by.

#### Purchase by Sunset Research Initiative

#### Interior

Ancient rumors about the Inner technology suggest that the technology inside seems as if its a century more advanced than the rest of man's ever was.





is undeniably the most technologically advanced structure constructed in the history of the human race.

This is inner eye.

Boo!

The completion of the most magnificent megastructure in history, the Prometheus Orbital, lead to an explosion in space infrastructure in the early 21st century. Even before Prometheus opened, Union and Coalition scientists and engineers were coordinating on a vision for a new, improved design that would give mankind total control over the Inner System.

These discussions and the subsequent program resulted in the failure of the Vulcan Joint Venture Orbital. Midway through its construction, the program would be halted indefinitely by unrelated military escalations, leaving behind a half-complete megastructure in Mercury orbit. 

For over half a century, the structure silently reminded mankind of its geopolitical reality. Never sealed and pressurized, Vulcan became a popular destination for interplanetary criminals and black operatives, who slipped deep into the structure when the occasional patrol frame passed by.

Eventually, the remains of Vulcan were purchased by the newly-formed Sunset Initiative during the 2070s, giving it a new life as the rebranded Odyssey United Orbital. Here, the construction of a mysterious pyramidal device was claimed to herald a new human age, a breakthrough in faster-than-light technology. The greatest symbol of human inability to cooperate would be converted into an icon of its strength and unity, or so they thought.

The name "Inner Eye" was chosen not but due to the structure, and general
