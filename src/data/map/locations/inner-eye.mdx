The `Inner Eye` resides within one of the many spacetime tears and folds of the broken space surrounding it. The structure isn't the largest orbital to exist; far from it actually, but it is perhaps the most magnificent of them. The vehicle was designed to accomodate about 50,000 crew, the majority of which would have been researchers, and to house the largest noetic system ever produced by human hands: `Project WHITE SERAPH`, the creator of the new world.

#### Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair

There have been millions of attempts to access the Inner Eye in the century since mankind's disappearance. Most of these have been by constituents of the `Consensus of a Dream`, the machine collective which seeks to learn the true fate of mankind, though the efforts have waned over time as they always seems to result in death. Or... perhaps not death, but no one who wanders into the collapsed reality seems to return, which is considered a failure of core directive.

All the machine world has to operate from are ancient documents and specifications, most of which have seemingly been eradicated or safeguarded by a vicious digital entity known as `Erasure`. It is widely known that the device within was activated by the Sunset Research Initiative on Unity Day, the scheduled end of all of mankind's troubles with violence and self-destruction. It may be better recognized as the Unexpected Interrupt, the day mankind vanished... May 5, 2095. 

It is pretty clear that the device's activation went differently than expected.

#### Origins as Vulcan Joint Venture

Design of the structure began in the late 20th century as the second collaboration between the American and Soviet space programs. Construction of the vessel began soon after the completion of Prometheus, the first orbital-class station which remains in orbit around Mars today. The project was named `Vulcan`: a new, improved design that removed the issues present in Prometheus.

Midway through the construction of Vulcan, a number of military escalations and political incidents elsewhere lead to a temporary pause in the process. As relations between the Greater Union and Enduring Coalition soured once again, as they always eventually did, this pause became indefinite, leaving a half-complete megastructure vacant in Mercury orbit.

For half a century, the shell sat incomplete over Mercury, silently reminding mankind of is political reality. Though incomplete, its reactor was fully functional and the system remained in orbit. As it was never sealed and pressurized, Vulcan became a popular destination for interplanetary criminals and black operatives, who slipped deep into the structure when the occasional patrol frame passed by.

#### Purchase by Sunset Research Initiative

Eventually, the old, mangled frame of Vulcan was purchased and rehabilitated by the newly-formed Sunset Research Initiative during the early 2060s. The Inner Eye, as it was now named, soon became the new home of the organization: a safe place to conduct numerous noetic experiments, bureaucratic processes, and store classified data, far from prying eyes. (The irony is not lost on this unit.)

Most importantly, the orbital became the site of the construction of an enormous pyramid-shaped device at the center of the rotating system. SRI claimed this device would herald a new human age. 

The greatest symbol of human inability to cooperate was converted into an icon of its strength and unity. That was the idea, anyway.
