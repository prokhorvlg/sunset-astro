`Voyager 399` is one of hundreds of similar observation outposts once employed by all three major powers, a small shift-crewed space station armed with a dizzying assortment of sensors and cameras. 

What makes 399 special is its position in the Kuiper Belt, making it by far the most remote human-populated location in the Solar System. It took over a month for a thumper to reach the position in 2035, another month for it to return, and a specialized deep-space thumper has made the voyage every two years. 

Its official purpose was to make clear observations of extremely remote Kuiper objects, and it has done so well, 
emphasized by its discovery of the Marduk-Nibiru planetary system in 2041. Some have said it was *actually* meant to be a psychological experiment, examining the effects of true isolation. 

Only one crewman remained here for longer than a single shift: `Dr. Baltasar Abreu`, a researcher hell-bent on understanding the world of Nibiru and the warped reality surrounding it using the only known tool for the job. In 2049, he would embark on the IAV Horizon and ultimately never return.
