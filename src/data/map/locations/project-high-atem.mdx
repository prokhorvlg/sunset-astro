Prior to the Interrupt, the existence of the `High Atem` was surprisingly well known for a typically-elusive Sunset Research Initiative program. Though its whereabouts were always kept classified, it was no secret that the vessel was one of the few nuclear-pulsed interplanetary thumpers in civilian use. 

Thanks to a particularly powerful presence in the public eye, there was no shortage of rumors about the vessel. Though, in retrospect, deep statistical analysis reveals there were actually *too many* stories. The High Atem seemed to appear in more places than it possibly could have at recorded travel speeds, and did far more than it should have been capable of as a modified Coalition frame. Was it really just a cargo-personnel transporter?

Well, SRI was involved, so certainly not.

Several decades after the Interrupt, the High Atem was spotted again. This time, it appears to be somewhere within the Kuiper Belt, and has remained there for as long as it has been observed. It is far too distant to be reached any time soon, nor is there much desire to; the region appears to be a dangerous reality field far from civilization.
