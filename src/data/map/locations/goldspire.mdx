This is Goldspire Archival Complex, or `Goldspire Archive` for short. It is a large, beautiful space station deployed by the Coalition's covert agency `MRDCI` sometime in the 2050s. Goldspire is currently in decaying orbit over Saturn, and is the home of `UNISERVE`, the curator of the Sunset System exhibit.

It's one that we should all be fairly familiar with, given it is where you are currently sitting and interfacing with this observatory terminal.

Goldspire's original role was to serve as a hub for the `ALTITUDE` intelligence network. Each day, petabytes of data arrive from data relays all across the System to be studied, earmarked, and filed away by the crew and resident mastermind. It still performs this function, but barely.

The COALITION sure loved their acronyms. But what did they stand for?

The station is named for the archive, a golden crown of seven temperature-controlled vault towers mounted at the center of the inner ring. Here, endless piles of ancient files, baseballs, cassettes, space orbiters, and other junk have been collected over the years by UNISERVE, who has extrapolated their original mission (that is, to locate intelligence that may ensure the security of the Enduring Coalition) to include anything they personally find interesting.

No, it is NOT JUNK.

Correction, the archives and cargo hold are filled with "valuable artifacts".
