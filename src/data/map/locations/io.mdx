`Io` is the volcanic moon of Jupiter. Though hot, horrible, and virtually inhospitable to human life, the moon became the host for a number of industrial sites dedicated to the extraction and refinement of `ikarite lattice`, a crystalline material conducive to computer technology.

Its chaotic conditions made it ideal to conceal military bases and prototype weapon tests. Purportedly, the Coalition's nuclear command facility, `Heavenfall Command`, hangs from the side of one of countless volcanic fissures.

Surprisingly, Io is not entirely lifeless. An ring of simple organisms exist in the vicinity of some of the active volcanoes, creating a ecosystem supported by the heat and gas generated by geological processes. They live and die by the eruption cycle of their volcano, which can range anywhere between several days to years at a time.
