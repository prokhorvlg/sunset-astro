Phaeton, or more accurately `Phaeton's Core`, is a metal-rich body roughly the size of Pluto, and the largest asteroid within the Phaeton Belt. A large number of largely automated mining operations operate here.

#### Destroyed fifth planet

Though originally classified as a mere dwarf plant, the unusual composition of the body made caused Phaeton to be the focus of much astrophysics research throughout the 20th century. 

Orbiters and landers launched in the 1980s confirmed the predominant theory surrounding Phaeton. It was the final remaining part of a `destroyed fifth planet` from the Sun, and in fact was the very core of this planet, cooled and weathered over hundreds of millions of years. By extension, the Asteroid Belt was confirmed to be the debris field remaining from the ancient explosion that caused the planet's destruction, and was thus renamed.

There are a few theories for how Phaeton was destroyed. The widely accepted one postulates that Phaeton was struck by a rogue body, causing an explosion that permanently obliterated the planet. However, given that pre-Earth experienced a similar event but eventually reformed into Earth and Luna, this theory is not as comprehensive as the scientific community would have wished.
