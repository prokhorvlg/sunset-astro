`Klios` is a small frozen moonlet consisting primarily of frozen carbon dioxide. 

Geologically, it may be the most perplexing body in the Solar System. Core samples suggest that the moonlet is partially made of Venusian material, some as recent as 100 million years old. Despite this, no crater could be found to match the impact that may have provided the material, nor do those samples seem to match with what humanity knew about Venus. They point to a much more hot, hostile, greenhouse-blanketed world incapable of supporting Earth life. 

The only explanation, really, would be that Klios was created by some event that is completely unknown to mankind and astrophysics. Either that, or it was artificially created, though this theory was never accepted by the scientific community. After all, no one has ever found any evidence of intelligent alien life. Right?

It is home to a small number of largely automated mining facilities dedicated to extracting frozen carbon dioxide, mostly for use in cryogenics, such as cooling and freezing foodstuffs shipped out from Venus and Merdem's Ring. Basically, the dry ice capital of the System... not really an impressive title.
