`Sol`, the Sun itself, is the great big ball of superheated gas and flame at the center of everything. It is the orb around which all conscious beings, and all things that have ever been touched by them, revolves; and it is the largest power source in the entire Solar System. The star is more massive than everything else in the System combined several times, yet it is all entirely inaccessible, though people have tried.

There are a large number of various probes, satellites, and space stations in close orbit around the Sun. A few of these objects are not even truly *in orbit*, as they are statically positioned, riding the intense solar winds to remain aloft.

#### Solar activity

Sol does not make space travel especially safe. Although the habitable worlds are usually shielded from solar storms by atmospheres and magnetic fields, spacecraft such as thumpers and orbitals are forced to take strong precautions to avoid being damaged or destroyed by charged particles ejected during solar flares. It is often recommended that machines stay well away from ejections. 

Thankfully, the path and shape of these events can usually be predicted far in advance due to close observation of the star.
