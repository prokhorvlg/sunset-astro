`Earth` is the first living world, the cradle of all civilization. It hosts a wide variety of biomes, climates, ecosystems, and life forms - far more diverse than any other living world discovered in the Solar System. It is the birthplace of humanity and the machine, of the nuclear-pulsed thumper and the common floppy diskette. This is where the System-wide Cold War began, as well as the eternal Space Race, when the probes first launched towards its cosmic neighbors.

Throughout the Cold War, Earth's biosphere was dying. The `Neutron Wars`, a series of proxy conflicts that made use of tactical nuclear warheads and dirty bombs, were responsible for the planet's slow spiral in the late 20th century. 

In their great wisdom, the leaders of Earth looked up and set their sights upon the newly discovered living worlds: Venus, Mars, Europa, Titan. Their ecosystems were unspoiled by atomic poison, and were ripe and ready for the taking. The perfect place to begin the next chapter: here, new colonies and cities would be sculpted into a model of their ideologies. 

The future was just few very large atomic rockets away...

#### Today (one century after mankind vanished)

After mankind vanished from reality, something happened to Earth... something so strange that it is incredibly difficult for most machines to properly quantify it. Earth is no longer "Earth", the way the memory files say it was. A planet still exists here, but that's really all that can be said. From one orbital perspective, Earth can be a lush garden world filled with strange glass skyscrapers. From another, it can be a nuclear wasteland, and that all changes every minute. Cities, forests, even landmasses contort as history itself seems to be in flux.

The machine world has come to know this anomalous effect as `Deadlock`, the broken reality. For Earth is a battleground, where many parallel histories, concepts, and worldviews appear to compete to be true for just a few compute cycles. Nothing ever comes or returns from its surface, besides troves of miscellaneous signals and unknown ephemeral robots that only exist for moments.
