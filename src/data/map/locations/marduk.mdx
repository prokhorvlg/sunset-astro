Ever since researchers performed their first gravimetric analysis of the Solar System, things just didn't add up. These miscalculations would mount significantly when examining the Kuiper Belt, a massive disc of frozen objects several hundred times more massive than the Phaeton Belt at the very edge of observable space.

The astrophysicist community of the System was eventually able to trace down the gravitational anomalies to a specific location just beyond the abrumpt distant edge of the mysterious Kuiper Belt: a mass roughly the size of a gas giant, responsible for the lack of material at this distance. The mystery was finally solved, and the calculations landed in place.

But they found nothing there.

Telescopes, even those constructed specifically to locate the mysterious mass such as `DOOS-1`, literally saw nothing at all. Probes were sent to examine several possible sites of this mass, to no avail. Circulating hypothesis ranged from the mundane to the bizarre, with the most accepted one attributing the mass to some sort of miniature black hole undetectable to modern imaging technology.

That changed after `the Crossing`. In 2041, a neuromorphic intelligence aboard the fringe outpost `399 Voyager` was processing observations of the Alpha Centauri system when it earmarked a strange dark disc passing across one of its many sensors for several frames.

Further examination of this data revealed that the disc was a small planet orbiting a cold gas giant at far edge of the Kuiper Belt, which came to be known as `Nibiru` and `Marduk` respectively. For some baffling reason, these worlds only became visible at certain angles from certain locations within the System; which only enkindled the international drive to visit this new member of the interplanetary community and exploit it for the benefit of mankind.

The `IAV Horizon` was launched with a manned expedition several years later in 2049, never to return. There was no second attempt.
