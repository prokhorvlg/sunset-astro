The `65-G` is one of several privately-owned `dataframes` cycling between the colonized worlds, slow vessels carrying copies of the entire Datanet.

While this method has incredibly slow communication speeds relative to laser relays, it was cheap and accessible, capable of servicing high-bandwidth gigastreams.
