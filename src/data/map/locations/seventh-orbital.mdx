The `Seventh Orbital` is an orbital-class space station nested within Earth-Moon Lagrange point L5. While the original underlying structure is human-designed, the vast majority was improvised by the machine architects assigned to its construction. 

Construction of the station began during the Era of Creation under human supervision in 2089. `Hiranya Orbital` was meant to serve as the Pact's first solo-operated orbiting city, a hub of cultural and military force projection housing over half a million residents, cementing the nation's status as an interplanetary superpower standing shoulder-to-shoulder to the Union and Coalition.

The design of the megastructure is fractal and disjointed, reflecting the evolution and divergence of machine thought in the wake of mankind's disappearance. Though all new additions *technically* reflect specifications provided by mankind, the lack of direction has allowed the machines to interpret them in increasingly bizarre ways. For instance, the newly-built Restroom Alpha is an enormous cube filled with one million toilets, packed together for maximum efficiency while still fifteen minutes away from any human room by monorail. "Storage closets" the size of stadiums permit entire new portions to be unpressurized, ideal for certain machine populations.

One century after the Unexpected Interrupt, the Seventh Orbital serves as the hub of machine world activity. Much like the reality field surrounding the station, it is a place where ideas and concepts converge and battle in a net-neutral space. The orbital is maintained and administered by the `Consensus of the Seventh Orbital`, a machine collective descended from the original construction robots who desire nothing other than to expand the megastructure, and will build new modules for other consensus to that end.
