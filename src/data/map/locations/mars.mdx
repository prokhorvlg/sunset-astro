`Mars` is the fourth planet from the Sun and one of the earliest living worlds to be explored. Despite its lack of water and extreme heat, Mars hosts multiple biomes and thriving ecosystems reminiscent of Earth's savannahs and deserts. Though interest in colonizing Mars was low in the early Space Race, the discovery of gravity-defying metamaterials within local wildlife sparked renewed interest. These efforts were primarily spearheaded by the Rising Pact, an alliance of East Asian powers including Japan, Korea, and India.

Mars's largest settlement is the `Shinzokasei Special Administrative Region`, an enormous technology capital squeezed into one of the few habitable zones of the planet. It is situated at the edge of the Red Sands, near the Ancient Canals, one of the only natural sources of liquid water. An unusual political history technically classifies Shinzo an independent city, but after a century of interdependence with the Pact, it was difficult to distinguish where one ends and the other begins. 

Most of the population here was `Daguist`, followers of a digital-era religion similar to Buddhism which involved neuromorphs in the cycle of reincarnation and enlightenment. 

#### Abandoned, then rediscovered

In the early days of the Space Race, Mars brought much fascination to the world. Even before astronauts landed on its surface, orbiters revealed enormous living structures underneath planet-spanning gulfs of sand, sweeping savannahs across its surface, even strange world-scars through which liquid water flowed.

But soon after the Americans planted their first outposts, they set their eyes on the far more docile world of Titan, which would become their stronghold among the stars. They had lost interest in what they saw as a dry world of worthless sands, and moved on.

It wasn't until the Pact came along, much later, that Mars' true value was uncovered. The organisms of Mars were bioaccumulators for an exotic form of matter, which could be harvested and used for an antigravitational effect. By now, it had been too late for either the Union or the Coalition; the Pact had claimed the waters of the `Ancient Canals`, and had supreme control. Their city, Shinzokasei, was a shining beacon of their domination over Mars and industrial acuity.

Yet neither the Coalition nor the Union desired to reliquish their limited claim over the Sands. In the late 21st century, Mars became host to the `Shadow Conflicts`, the largest automated conflict in the Solar System. Hundreds of nuclear automatons were sent across the Sands to blast each other to bits, surrounded by hundreds of miles of nothing.

They would be commanded by cybernetic masterminds, as their human operators shut down their sensors. For is there a war if no human is around to hear the whine of the railguns?

#### Mirror rings 

Mars has special significance to the astrophysics communisty as the only rocky world with a true ring system. The reflective, mostly-metallic ring is very different from those of the gas giants in the Outer System, leading to its name, the `Mirror Ring`.

Though a few researchers hypothesized the Mirror Ring to be the remains of an artificial construct (such as an orbital ring), scientific consensus converged on a more plausible theory: that the metallic and rocky fragments that make up the ring system are simply the remains of `Phobos`, an ancient moon torn apart by tidal forces. Though it is the only occurence of a mirror ring within the System, there was little reason for human-era scientists to believe it was not natural.
