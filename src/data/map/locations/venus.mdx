`Venus` is the second planet from the Sun, often known as the "caustic jungle world" for its toxic biomes and aggressive alien life. The living world was mainly colonized by the Greater People's Union of Earth, including the Soviets, China, and Iran, though there are a few notable Pact cities and outposts as well. Through radical genetic engineering and explosive terraformation, a large portion of the surface became dedicated to farmland, ultimately turning the planet into the "breadbasket of the System".

#### Toxic deathworld transformed into viable farmland

When the probe first landed here, it transmitted a grainy image of a lush alien jungle, wet and hot, teeming with life. Venus's soil was rich in nutrients, and her biology a master at rapid growth. It was the first alien ecosystem to be confirmed to exist, and as news of the discovery made rounds around the globe, a new flame erupted under the engines of the Space Race.

Venus was the first living world to be colonized, but never truly tamed. The Soviets tried. They launched everything they had towards it: from sending steel behemoths to burn away wide swaths of its surface area, to constructing massive concrete barriers around their colonial lands, and launching bio-engineered viruses into the depths.

Regardless, Venus was the Union's most successful endeavor, and the nation's largest claim. The sanitized lands made for incredible farmland, and the living world would rapidly become the breadbasket for the rest of the Solar System, as hundreds of tons of engineered corn, wheat, and tuber were shipped to Luna. Around the farmlands, fully-automated communes and academies of science formed a civilization worthy in the eyes the Communist vision.

This was the future.

#### Today (one century after mankind vanished)

Today, Venus's colonies have been largely consumed by alien jungle and hivemind insectoids as nature rapidly reclaims what was once hers. The `Institute of Agriculture`, once a shining beacon of Union domination over the natural world, lies half-submerged underneath hundreds of meters of canopy and swamp juice. The machine world clings to life, but only barely.
