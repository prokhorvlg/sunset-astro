Interbeacon, the largest statite space station to exist, is a technological wonder, a palace of secrets, and weapon of imperial domination. It is the nerve center of the Union interplanetary information network, the Aggregate.



Interbeacon was an enormous statite built to syncronize the Aggregate, the Union's interplanetery datanet. Today, it hosts RADIUS, the final remnant of the Union's automated economic planning system. Their voice booms across the skies, visible from all points in the System.
