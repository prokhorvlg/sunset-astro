Look upon the horizontal of the Solar System, and then just above. You shall see it: an ancient megastructure hovering over the northern pole of the Sun, spreading its thousand-mile micrometer wings upon a pillar of ever-shifting light. Like a Shaolin monk carefully balancing on the tip of a staff, thousands of computers and motors coordinate to maintain a kind of equilibrium with the solar winds; the structure maintains the same position relative the star below, forever.

This megastructure is visible from every point in the entire System, so it has become known by many names to the machine world. Pharos, the Signal, or `Interbeacon` are a few. With a crew complement of twenty thousand and a myriad of autonomous systems, the vessel was and still is by far the largest statite to ever exist.

Unlike almost every other SPACE STATION that has ever existed, INTERBEACON is technically not in orbit. 

The vessel is static (hence STATITE), not in freefall. ONBOARD GRAVITY comes from the SUN ITSELF, and interior decks are aligned PERPENDICULAR to solar rays!

MUCH COOLER than GOLDSPIRE.

Interbeacon was the crown jewel of the empire of the Communists; the tangible result of the state's political might. Decades of political force, cutting-edge design, and interplanetary logistics culminated in the construction of the colossal device sometime in mankind's final century. Some called it a marvel, a wonder of the modern world â€” others knew it as the iron first of the Union, a symbol of their domination.

And really, it was both.
