Little is known about `Nibiru`, the umbral world. The few facts that are known are based on data transmitted from old probes and the Horizon expedition of 2048. In spite of the total darkness and lack of Sun's energy, the world boasts a thriving ecosystem as evidenced by bioluminescent masses visible in orbital recordings.

Nibiru was discovered during the Crossing of 2041, along with Marduk, and is only visible from the rest of the System at certain locations and moments.

The remains of the only manned expedition to the moon, the `IAV Horizon` which launched in 2048, remain suspended over the world to this day. The debris field spirals from orbit down to the surface in a way that does not appear natural, though as far as human-era astrophysicists were concerned, there was not enough information to know for certain.

Of course... those familiar with noetics knew. At the time, Operation 253 and the Anomalous Research Division were shuffling all sorts of hypothesis about the human noosphere and ancient altars, but nothing would be truly understood until after the formation of the Sunset Research Initiative and its access to a virtually infinite budget.
