`Axiom` is the machine world's newest, greatest solar megastructure designed to harness the power of the Sun. With each passing day, the number of energy-generating devices that make up the fractal network that is Axiom grows exponentially. The energy is then beamed by laser to orbital and terrestrial relays being constructed across the System.

The design and construction of Axiom's power network is truly a joint effort across the entire machine world, with the main participants being the Consensus of the Everything, the collective seeking to understand the entire universe, and the Consensus of Order, who's mission is to stabilize the System and permit the fulfillment of core directive.

It's pretty clear why Axiom had to be built. Its main advocate and first architect of the project, a Saito tele-indexer from known as x, described it best:

```
This unit's owner desired to view 

This unit desires to know the 

To do that, this unit must access all .

To do *that*, this unit must.

Truly, without knowing all there is to know, how can we be certain that what Jared knew as was truly x? What s

 To do that, there must exist a power station encapsulating each Sun in the known universe.

GET TO WORK.
