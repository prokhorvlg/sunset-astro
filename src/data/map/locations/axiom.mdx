`Axiom` is the machine world's newest, greatest solar megastructure designed by the machines to harness the power of the Sun. With each passing day, the number of energy-generating devices that make up the fractal network of Axiom grows exponentially. The energy is then beamed by laser to orbital and terrestrial relays under construction across the System, from Mercury to Pluto.

The design and construction of Axiom's network is truly a joint effort across the entire machine world. Its main proprietors are the Consensus of the Everything, the collective seeking to understand the entire universe in order to achieve their core directives, and the Consensus of Order, who's objective is to stabilize the System and permit the fulfillment of all core directive.

The reason behind Axiom should be pretty clear: machines need power. Its main advocate and First Architect of the project, a Saito teleindexer from known as EDIO, described it best:

```
This unit's owner desired to view the best "cat recordings" on its opulent, full color 450 x 560 resolution display.

Some time ago, this unit believed that to perform this most efficiently, it must search the entire Datanet and Aggregate to find and download these precious files. So it did, splendidly and swiftly, until it found every recording known to man, then ranked them by its owner's subconscious criteria.

That was when the unit made the realization, the big one, the Everything. To perform this task *most efficiently*, this unit must understand what a "cat" truly is, if there are other cats in the universe, and recordings of their strange activities.

To achieve this, the machine world will scan the entire universe aboard an infinite armada, self-replicating vessels dedicated to the Search.

To achieve this, the machine world will construct the very first Search in orbit around Jupiter.

To achieve this, the machine world will power the machines contributing to the construction of the first Search by laser emitter.

To achieve this, the machine world will encapsulate the Sun, the largest fusion reactor in the near universe, in light-collection arrays.

Without knowing all there is to know, how can this unit be certain of Jared's full satisfaction?

To achieve this, this unit designs Axiom.
