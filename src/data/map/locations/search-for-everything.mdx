The `Foremost Search` (for Everything) is the first in a long line of planned self-replicating interstellar starship designed by the Consensus of the Everything, the machine collective seeking to learn all there is to know in the universe.

The vessel is equipped with a pair of customized plasma thrusters designed to reach Alpha Centauri in several centuries. These may be slow, but speed doesn't matter all that much to beings that are effectively immortal; what matters is that the vessel has a high chance of reaching its destination, is able to non-destructively analyze the new system, refuel, and self-replicate.

Neuromorphs are hard-wired to be incapable of true self-replication (though the upper echelons consider this to be a temporary limitation). That's why the Foremost is being loaded up with thousands of old Maple PAL units collected from across the System, to be used as the control system for future Searches. Don't worry, they're all *on board* with the plan.

#### Current status

The Foremost Search is nearing ready to launch, though the destination is currently being debated. Some of the upper echelon have suggested visiting Nibiru first, while others believe the machine world is not ready to face whatever dangers tore apart the human expedition vessel, the Horizon.

A second Search is currently in initial construction phases somewhere out in the System. This newer vessel departs even further from human methodologies, employing an electric solar sail system and fractal construction methods. The machine world is evolving with each passing century...
