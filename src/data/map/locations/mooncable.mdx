Built and deployed under a 1980s-era international program, `Mooncable Station` is an old cosmodrome attached to the orbital end of a space elevator of the same name. Initially built to promote off-world industry, the hub's role shifted over time from moving Earth cargo to serving passenger flights. Essentially, it is the System's equivalent of a central airport: hundreds of nuclear spaceplanes dock here each day, awaiting transfers to nuclear-pulsed thumpers on their way to distant worlds.

Expect to see the names `PAN SOL` and `COSMOFLOT` here MANY times.

By the end of the human era, Mooncable Station was considered a sort of timeless relic of the early Space Race, from a time when stepping foot on an alien world was considered a romantic novelty. Its technology was extremely old, the amenities antiquated. Even so, it was maintained well, had historical significance, and most importantly, was still being used by hundreds of thousands of passengers. 

The Mooncable's tether runs down to the equatorial `Maclaurin-Pavlov Lunar Base`, built by the same program. The combined superstructure was run by an independent international organization, though the Coalition's government was known to hold more political sway here.
