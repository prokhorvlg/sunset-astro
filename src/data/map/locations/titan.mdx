`Titan` is the largest moon of Saturn, considered to be the most distant living world from Earth, at about one week away under typical conditions. It was the primary colonization target for the Enduring Coalition, a federation that consisted of most of the Western powers of Earth including the United States, Brazil, and West Germany. 

Titan's ecosystem is mainly based on fungal magnetotrophs which evolved to survive by harvesting energy from the slow orbit of Titan around Saturn. These form `blooms` on the surface of the world, ranging from something very similar to some of Earth's coniferous forests, to organisms blanketing entire continents with very little room for human activity. These blooms are home to the `slugma`, a number of species which somewhat resemble Earth's slugs. They are extremely slow and feed on electrical energy produced by the magnetotrophs.

According to the deep geological record of Titan, there was a time very long ago when the world was entirely frozen over, the surface was covered in hydrocarbons, and the atmosphere was thick with methane. Though the science is unclear, it appears that ancient life on this world evolved to consume those elements, and ultimately warmed this world into something suitable for human habitation over tens of millions of years.

Lucky humans!
