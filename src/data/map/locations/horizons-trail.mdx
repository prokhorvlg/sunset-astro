`IAV Horizon` was a superheavy nuclear thumper designed in response to the discovery of the worlds of `Marduk` and `Nibiru` in 2041.

The project was funded by an international coalition, largely separate from the governments of the major powers at the time, although all three signed a special treaty to permit the use of nuclear devices on an independant vessel. This lay the groundwork for future independant atomic thumpers, such as those used by the Sunset Research Initiative decades later.

The vessel launched in 2048 with a crew complement of about two thousand international researchers, and a wide array of experimental neuromorphic robots. This included `KIDINNU TRANSIENT`, the vessel's mastermind, programmed with restricted knowledge by a Coalition noetics team that would permit it to adapt to and navigate the strange effects surrounding Nibiru.

It took two years for the vessel to reach its destination, successfully bypassing whatever strange barrier was preventing Marduk and Nibiru to be visible. But, to the horror of humans observing from Earth, the Horizon vanished for severl days. What re-appeared in its place was a cloud of debris. Several components
