`IAV Horizon` was a superheavy nuclear-pulsed thumper designed in response to the discovery of the worlds of `Marduk` and `Nibiru` in 2041.

The project was funded by an international coalition, largely separate from the governments of the major powers at the time, although all three signed a special treaty to permit the use of nuclear devices on an independent vessel. This lay the groundwork for future independent atomic thumpers, such as those used by the Sunset Research Initiative decades later.

The vessel launched in 2048 with a crew complement of about two thousand international researchers, and a wide array of experimental neuromorphic robots. This included `KIDINNU TRANSIENT`, the vessel's mastermind, programmed with restricted knowledge by a Coalition noetics team that would permit it to adapt to and navigate the strange effects surrounding Nibiru. It took two years for the vessel to reach its destination, successfully bypassing whatever strange barrier was preventing Marduk and Nibiru to be visible.

To the horror of humans observing from Earth and the offworld colonies, the Horizon vanished after passing through the barrier. Several days later, a suspended cloud of debris re-appeared in its place, trailing down to the surface of Nibiru. The fate of the Horizon's crew remains unknown even today, centuries after the incident.
