Sometimes, not even the most perfect, mastermind-generated plan goes as expected.

`Tolkiy Orbital` began as a perfect solution to the Union's Venusian troubles. The vessel, constructed mostly by automated systems in the 2040s, is an enormous ring structure with a unique sloped wall design which permits a maximum number of interior units to have window access to the outside. 

`Merdem's Ring`, originally known as Tolkiy People's Orbital, was the Union's second attempt at producting an orbital station.
