`Merdem's Ring` is an independent orbital under the authority of Merdem Independent Ring responsible for handling most of Venus's cargo shipments and food processing.

As Venus was quickly becoming the "breadbasket" of the System in the 2040s, nearly outproducing Earth in food and other consumable products thanks to a few brilliant genetic innovations mixed with pristine alien soil, the Union began to run into a bit of an issue: *too much stuff*. There were far more orbiters than terrestrial cosmodromes could handle, and likewise too many vessels resting in orbit. 

Thus, `Tolkiy Orbital` was created. It would be a massive space station to handle the processing and spaceport duties of all this food. Constructed mostly by automated systems in the 2040s, the structure is an enormous ring with a unique sloped wall design, which permits a maximum number of interior units to have window access to the outside. The interior architecture is highly industrial and brutalist, quick to build and properly representing the Union's.

In 2068, something happened. 

`Merdem's Ring`, originally known as Tolkiy People's Orbital, was the Union's second attempt at producting an orbital station.

Though no nation ever formally recognized the authority of Merdem and continued to refer to the orbital as Tolkiy, the Coalition and Pact would eventually come to deal with Merdem.
