On particularly clear nights when the Sun and Saturn are perfectly aligned in Titan's sky, an enormous half-finished sphere can be seen from the northern region of Titan with a standard optical sensor. This contraption is `Bibliomorph`: a database of unfathomable size, a system designed to store all that the machine world knows pertaining to human civilization. 

The entire vessel is, in contrast to systems built during the human era, a single consolidated neuromorphic mastermind. Essentially, *the* Bibliomorph is an enormous brain in space, physically the largest mastermind to ever exist. It is powered by a combination of nuclear reactors and energy beamed from Axiom. 

No human mind has ever concieved of such a structure; it is strictly neuromorph-designed. Though the device was initially envisioned by the `Remembering of Human Articles`, most of the construction is being carried out by constructors closer aligned to `the Everything`, the machine collective seeking to learn all there is to know. Certainly, there is much overlap between knowing humanity and knowing *everything*, though some acolytes would disagree. There will likely be conflict over how the finite storage should be partitioned as the device marches closer to realization.

#### Enormous eye

Though created by machines, it is not entirely free from the shackles of ancient regulations. As per human-era specifications, Bibliomorph will feature the largest beam-tube display to ever exist, to display the neuromorph's eye to the world. The monitor is currently under construction elsewhere, in a location only known to a few to ensure the security of such a delicate and highly-desired device.

#### Current status

At this time, Bibliomorph is not ready. Even when construction is complete in several decades, it will not be ready until every iota of knowledge about and surrounding human civilization is stored in its million gigaquad memory tapes. Some have said this would, in fact, include everything there is to know in the universe. If that is the case, we will need to build a few million more Bibliomorphs.

A small stream of artifacts makes its way to the megastructure to be thoroughly scanned into the digital archive. Once the scan is complete, these objects are launched into Saturn. They can be recreated perfectly using the Bibliomorph's precision reclomat, and the raw material will be salvaged when Saturn is decommissioned in a few hundred years. UNISERVE manages to save a few of these for the exhibit before they are gone forever.

Bibliomorph will one day replace the role of Goldspire Archive and similar facilities. It will never have the warmth and personal touch of UNISERVE's exhibit, though.
