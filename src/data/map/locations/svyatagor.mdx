There really isn't much special about `Svyatagor Station`, besides where it's located. The design is an assembly of fairly standard People's Union modules, including a small spherical spinner hab and a series of sensor units. The vessel was launched sometime in the early 21st century, mainly to coordinate a small network of spy satellites and probes and record the Coalition's development on Titan. Somehow, the station was somewhat forgotten and has been running on life support ever since, likely due to its remoteness relative to most Union activity.

Or, perhaps it's a bit more than that...

According to some of the really old files left by an MRDCI intelligence officer at Goldspire Archive, Svyatagor's run-down state was just a cover to divert curiousity. In reality, the vessel was critical in coordinating the Union's `NKGB` agents and their deployment among the population of Titan.
