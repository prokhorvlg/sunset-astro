Unlike the other massive consensus of the post-mankind machine world, the `Consensus of Genesis` does not aim to construct any major orbital facilities. These robots, seeking to recreate mankind through biological means, opt to operate in existing laboratories and outposts, primarily on or near Europa and Venus.

One of these facilities is `Tiān Pharmaceutical`, a small crewed outpost built in the 2020s to perform zero-g experimentation using live animals, likely to test various experimental acclimation drugs.

At one point, the cages and cloning vats at Tiān were filled with squids and apes. Today, they are filled with something far more disturbing: "humans", created by a more radical faction within Genesis. It would be inaccurate to call them human, however, as the creatures are really biological constructs based on the aggregate of various robotic visions of what a human *should* be. The machine world has come to know the failures as the `Human By Committee`.

Thankfully, the structure can be destroyed with relative ease, should someone decide to do so. Anyone?
