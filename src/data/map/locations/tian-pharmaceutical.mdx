Unlike the other massive consensus of the machine world, the Consensus of Genesis does not aim for the construction of any major orbital facilities. These robots, seeking to recreate mankind through biological means, often opt to operate in existing laboratories and outposts, primarily on or near Europa and Venus.

One of these facilities is TiƒÅn Pharmaceutical, an orbital outpost built in the 2020s to perform zero-g . It is here that a number of human homunculi have been created, which can be hypothetically disposed of by obliterating the structure.

It is the site of the Human By Committee.
