The `Sanket Star` is a large five-pointed space station orbiting Neptune. The station was built in the 2080s by the Pact's `Hwaling-Sanket` energy syndicate to produce significant quantities of antimatter, as well as to conduct various particle physics research in the safety of deep cosmos.

The remote position was chosen deliberately for its distance from known military positions. Though still reachable by nuclear-pulse thumper within two to three weeks of transit, even within a week at extreme speeds, the vessel is remote enough to be considered "survivable" in the event of a nuclear war. Control over Sanket would leave the Pact with the largest and most reliable supply of energy in the System, even after apocalypse.

Though not quite on the scale of an orbital, the highly-automated Sanket features many of the amenities you may expect in a proper city: full simulation domes, sports complex, pools and restaraunts. This was necessary in order to maintain the sanity of a crew expected to operate remotely for potentially years at a time. As there is no shortage of energy here, these systems appear to be fully operational, though their supplies and capacity for repair are dwindling.
