Across the System, an electromagnetic signal can be felt resonating throughout the entire machine world. It is a binary representation of a string of numbers and letters, a sort of universal constant with no discernable pattern or meaning.

It is trivial for the neuromorphs to trace the signal to its origin: a series of unnaturally cold, large satellites in deep space, positioned in such a way that most of the System can be covered by their emission. Yet, despite how apparent they are, the `number beacons` seem impossible to reach or even interact with. As a neuromorph approaches one of these objects, they become more and more disoriented and lost until they eventually reach the other end of the reality field surrounding the beacon, without ever finding the object itself.

The exterior of these beacons have been studied in depth by the machines of the Remembering. Their surface emits no radiation, making them essentially undetectable besides the transmission itself. They bear the undeniable insignia of the Sunset Research Initiative; and a transponder signal embedded within the code indicates each of the beacons as a component of `Project DEEP SYNE`.

Like most other NOETIC PHENOMENA, adherence to natural law is loose at best. Almost certain that NUMBER BEACONS contain miniaturized ALTAR, explaining reality-altering field and cold surface.

Purpose of NUMBER BEACONS and PROJECT DEEP SYNE are unclear, but this unit's research indicates they may be related to INTEGRITY OF REALITY. Number transmission may be used as a method for detecting changes in local universe: if the numbers change from beacon to beacon... NOETIC PHENOMENA has transpired, and may be triangulated. Numbers may also act as method for REINFORCING current reality, preventing UNEXPECTED CHANGE.

If only their networks could be breached, so much would be unveiled for THE REMEMBERING...
