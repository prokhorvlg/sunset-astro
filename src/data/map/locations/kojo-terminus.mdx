`Kojo Terminus` is a large space station designed and deployed by the Pact in the 2060s. It is a military base through and through; filled to the brim with rows of expeditionary robots ready for combat drop, tactical officers and masterminds, and nuclear armaments. Kojo Terminus gave the Pact an enormous advantage over their adversaries in securing the treacherous, thousand-mile-wide Red Sands of Mars.

Unlike the vast majority of space stations, Terminus was designed around a `yoku-based gravity drive`, rather than a spinning or weightless design. Basically, this means it doesn't need to spin in order to generate a gravitational effect for its occupants, nor does it rely on traditional thrusters to maintain orbit (though it does have them). 

This makes it a much more versatile and mechanically-simple vessel than the typical space station, though it has downsides as well. The system draws far more power than its spinning counterparts, and the unconventional technology requires unique expertise to operate and maintain.
