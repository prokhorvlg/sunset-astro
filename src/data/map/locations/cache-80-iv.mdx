Heavenbreaker's `Cache 80-IV` is one of hundreds of nuclear sleeper missile bundles residing within deep space. This one happens to be a set of Striker IVs deployed by the Coalition, but the Union and Pact employed very similar weapon platforms and deployment strategies.

`Sleeper missiles` were the next evolution of the nuclear arms race, the atomic bomb of the 21st century Space Age. These weapons, similar in size to an intercontinental missile, were designed to drift at minimal power to remain entirely undetectable to even the most thorough sensor sweep. Like nuclear submarines Earth-side, the location of a sleeper missile is unknown until the moment the weapon is commanded to launch, at which point the missile accelerates and deploys a cluster warhead to its target within hours. In some cases, they could even reach a destination and detonate in minutes.

These were truly devastating and terrible weapons, though thankfully, one has never been fired in an act of war. In an otherwise wonderful and peaceful age of Man, the dread of annihilation lingered above at all times.Ultimately, these lead to the creation of the `Sunset Research Initiative`, an organization which vowed to find a way to solve human conflict, once and for all.

And so they did.
