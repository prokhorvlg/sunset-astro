`Prometheus`, known as the *joint venture orbital*, was the first and only orbital built under direct cooperation between the Greater Union and the Enduring Coalition. 

Design of the Prometheus can be traced back to the earliest international cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union, during which plans for a massive conjoined space station were drawn up in order to form a jumping-off point for interplanetary colonization. Since this was fairly early on in the Space Race, Mars was still considered a primary target by all parties involved, so that's where the vessel was set to be built.

Construction of Prometheus began in Martian orbit in the early 1990s, mostly by manned crews and using material mined from initial asteroid captures. The space station would essentially be two massive counter-rotating cylinders, dedicated to the Union and Coalition respectively, for a total maximum population of about 270,000. These would be joined by a connecting structure known as the `Annex`, where the split leadership could carry out their duties.

The role of the orbital in interplanetary logistics rapidly diminished as colonies on Venus, around Saturn, and elsewhere took on a life of their own. Still, it played a critical role in maintaining balance in the System. The Annex was upgraded over time to serve as a neutral meeting ground, where government officials and agents could meet and hash out agreements during periods of geopolitical turmoil.

#### Primary purpose as ark

Although it was never expressed outright to the public, Prometheus' primary purpose was to serve as an ark, a vessel that preserves life and order in the event of nuclear armageddon not unlike its biblical counterpart. Since the station had little advantage to either party and was armed with its own set of countermeasures, it was designated a safe site and would never be targetted by strategic weaponry. In the event of a nuclear strike, the on-board automated system `LUCID` was assigned to trigger the `Final Dawn Protocol`, recalling critical members of the program to Prometheus and unleashing a series of seed banks hidden somewhere within the vessel.

#### Today (one century after mankind vanished)

For some reason, LUCID and the Final Dawn Protocol remain entirely silent even a century after humans vanished during the Unexpected Interrupt. It seems that the strict parameters of its activation were simply never met.

Partial schematics uncovered by the machine world has revealed that the banks contained human material, as well as systems for reanimating it. This has made the Prometheus a topic of great interest to the academics of the Consensus of Genesis, who seek to revive biological man to serve as the shepherd of an otherwise aimless System.
