In 1995, the Greater Union launched a new kind of prototype vessel into close orbit around the Sun. `Yadron`, named after the Russian word for "core", was a technological marvel of its time. Once expanded and fully deployed, the vessel housed 500 international researchers in comfort until their mission was complete. 

During the twenty short, brilliant years of the station's planned lifespan, the crew of Yadron collected an impressive, detailed compendium of data about the star below. They also conducted a number of tests on solar weather and practical solar sail constructs, ultimately forming the testbed necessary for the design of the incredible `Interbeacon`, a statite which would eventually form the crux of the Union's interplanetary network.

Then... the mission was over, with Interbeacon set to replace all of Yadron's duties. However, held aloft by a propulsion engine powered by attached solar arrays, the space station was in no hurry to break apart and fall out of orbit. With the realization that Yadron had a potentially infinite lifespan, the Union's Ministry of Colonization shipped a contingent of military officers to occupy the station until command would figure out what to do with it.

#### The punishment

That time never came. Within a few years, the once luxurious habitat ring had become a grungy, uncomfortable, and cramped space bunker. The decrepit Yadron took on a new life as the *Punishment*: where all of the Union's most politically undesirable officers were shipped off to be forgotten.

In its later years, Yadron formed a strange new culture of isolated rejects. Here, unlike most other places within the Union, members from all branches, whether it be government, military, or intelligence, freely mingled and commiserated on their ennui and contempt for the system. We have often wondered whether Yadron's rejects continued their tradition even after being released from the Punishment.

#### Today (one century after mankind vanished)

Today, Yadron continues to orbit quietly around the Sun. The drones continue to perform minimal repairs to the vessel, and a small number of QUARK interfacers seem to have taken interest in the ancient card games the rejects once played here. One of them was called "durak", a word meaning "fool". Fascinating.

There's really no reason for it to go anywhere.
