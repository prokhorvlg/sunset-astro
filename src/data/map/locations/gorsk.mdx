`Great Gorsk`, the People's Station, was the largest orbital ever deployed by mankind. Its enormous population of about 350,000 residents would reside within the Capsule, an enormous rotating structure attached to a siphoning megastructure dropping a tether into Jupiter's atmosphere. 

Gorsk was the Union's most critical piece of infrastructure in the Outer Solar System, securing their grip on the Jovian region. With the construction of the Vulcan on indefinite pause due to geopolitical turmoil, construction of Gorsk occurred sometime around the 2030s, this time mostly by automated spaceborne robots as opposed to manned crews.

#### Social Experimentation

The encapsulated, isolated nature of Great Gorsk revealed itself to provide the Union with a second advantage beyond its strategic role.

In the late 2040s, the scientific administration of the Union was placed in charge of a new initiative. Under `Kosmograd`, NANCOM was to conduct a number of social experiments on the inhabitants of various interplanetary colonists in an attempt to find ways of implementing the next phase of "true communism" on a national level. The original political motivations behind the program have been lost to time.

The interior of Gorsk was gently redesigned into experimentation blocks of varying scale, each with carefully controlled and monitored inputs and outputs. They would eventually host tests administered by a new central laboratory. At its heart was a brand new mastermind: `VOLOS`, a system designed by Volken to supplement the efforts of the academicians and scientists. It assisted with devising, executing, and analyzing various strategies, though it is said that the system took over more functions with time.

These experiments ranged from the mundane to the extraordinary. Most blocks were subject to a cacophony of propaganda, urban planning, and psychological studies devised by students and academics on planet-side universities. Some even got rid of the concept of money entirely, even to great success, though it never seemed to scale beyond a certain block size. 

The most peculiar of these experiments pertained to influencing family and social dynamics, often through VOLOS' talent for subtle manipulation. Though the experiments had unusual parameters, they were rarely actually *cruel* to the inhabitants of the station.

Visitors from the outside world would comment on the strangeness of the residents. *"He had fifteen mothers."* *"They all referred to themselves in third person."* Though it came off as odd, such was life on Great Gorsk, until the Unexpected Interrupt took them all away.
