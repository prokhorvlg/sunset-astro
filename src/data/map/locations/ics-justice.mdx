The `ICS Justice Dawn` is a Justice-class thumper, a kind of spacecraft that rides the blast from an atomic blast underneath the vessel. This one is a `dawnframe`: a flagship, designed to deploy into a fully-fledged spaceport and military base while in orbit, capable of supporting remote colonies and fielding squadrons of sub-orbital bombers and interceptors. The Justice Dawn is the very definition of Space Age force projection.
