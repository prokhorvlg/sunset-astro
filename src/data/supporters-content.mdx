    This page is dedicated to the friends of Sunset System. These are some of the people who have helped me take this strange thought experiment to an incredible new level.

    A huge thank you to everyone on this page, and to anyone else that has supported my work!

    Special thanks to my partner, BLACK_VELVET, for putting up with me doing... whatever this is... when I'm not performing my primary functions.
