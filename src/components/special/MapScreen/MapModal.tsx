      Location
      MAP IN WESTON

      At the center of Weston Mission Control, you dust off an old, unused defense terminal. It is simply labeled VIEWER, and appears to be linked.

      Dynatek VIEWER

You've found at the Observatory, a representation of local reality in the post-mankind age. The system is directly linked to Goldspire Complex's advanced sensors, so dig deep and log your findings.

(If you're confused, an introduction can be found on the home page.)

Major worlds also link to regional maps. Explore them too - terrestrial locations are just as critical.
