Despite its distance from Earth, `Titan` (moon of Saturn) became a notable world in the Space Race. It was known for its beautiful and frigid landscapes, the largest mining operation for `tetradite` in the Solar System, and eventually sprawling suburbs around a powerful technology industry.

Since the first prospectors, rumors of incredible technology concealed by bloom and ice circulated among its people. Whether this was ever confirmed by the Coalition remains unknown to the machine world after mankind disappeared.
