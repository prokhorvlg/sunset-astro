## Enduring Coalition

- `Heavenbreaker Initiative`: Military, expeditionary, and maintenance arm of the Enduring Coalition. Repairs infrastructure, charts the worlds, maintains the nuclear arsenal.

- `MRDCI`: Department of Covert Intelligence for the Coalition. Does some very unsavory things. Operates ALTITUDE network, a system-wide surveillance network.

That's who operated this space station. We really see EVERYTHING.

- `Administration for Charitable Tribute (ACT)`: Handles all donations to Coalition efforts, something highly pressured in Coalition society. Distributes additional funding as deemed necessary.

## Greater Union

- `Committee for Scientific Integrity (NANCOM)`: Formed in the wake of Aggregate economic disaster. Administers national internet. Rules on merits and ethics of scientific programs.

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
NANCOM fielded a mastermind known as `RADIUS`, a massively powerful neuromorph in charge of the economic planning system. Their existence and exact design was covered up, but nonetheless, they controlled the Union economy for the better half of a century.

- `Ministry of Colonization (MINICOL)`: Military wing of the Union. Pretty similar role to Heavenbreaker.

- `Bureau of Agriculture (AGBURO)`: Handles Venusian terraforming efforts, farming, and genetic collection/engineering programs. Butts heads with Minicol.

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
Practically a military force of its own. Destroying the aggressive VENUSIAN BEATLES was a massive endeavor.

## Rising Pact

- `Hikari Energy & Telecom`: Syndicate for communication and other interplanetary infrastructure. Operates Pact's nuclear arsenal in space.

- `Kojo Automated Services`: Syndicate formed to design and manufacture military and other rugged robotic systems. Operates the Pact's terrestrial army.

- `Sankalpa Temple`: Responsible for mass manufacture and authorization of the creation of any new neuromorph. Butts heads with Kojo.

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
Due to their DAGUIST BELIEFS, which assured that `neuromorphic circuits were targets for reincarnation` and part of the collective soul, SANKALPA enforced a more ethical approach towards machine design.
