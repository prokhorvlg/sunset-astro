## <span class="short"><i>title:</i>Coalition luxury hovercars<i>:</i></span> The Jupiter Sentinel and the Bellini Silvar, a pair of luxury hovercars from the Coalition.

The `2089 Jupiter Sentinel` is a town car equivalent. It's designed to have a comfortable interior, more so than the average hovercar.

The `2095 Bellini Silvar` is in another category entirely. This one is a low-end supercar driven by moderately wealthy Coalition citizens who want to flaunt their wealth. Silvars are delicate vehicles, and since *some* of its drivers were avid users of certain powdery substances, these had a notorious statistical likelihood of crashing when these entered the electronics. Bellini even had to issue PSAs.

It recently occurred to THIS UNIT that brutalism made a comeback after HOVERCARS gained popularity in the 2080s, for EXPLOSIVE new reasons...

Hovercars are fairly safe due to multiple redundancies and the neuromorphic driver, but aerial incidents still occur from time to time.

They're equipped with [yoku coils](/posts/exotic-resources#liquid-nyxium-lantern), gravity-reducing devices that hail from the Pact (East Asian superstate that colonized Mars). These wrap the chassis of the vehicle, and make it easy to push it around using low thrust.

The `Wallace Grande` was one of Wallace's many offerings in the camper van space, one of their most popular alongside commuter sedans. Sleek and mustardy!

The robot here is an Emerson device from the same product line as [PRAGMA](/posts/eye-screens).

Records indicate EMERSON UNIT did not attend this road trip. This unit wonders where they are now.

Jura is a popular Union manufacturer eventually headquartered in Vostok City on Venus, which saw the highest number of hovercars per capita than any other city in the Solar System.

Whether these vehicles are "luxury" is highly debatable, especially when stacked against highly desired Ottowagen counterparts imported from West Germany.

Don't tell them that, though. It is RUDE.

The 2036 `Jura Barracuda` is a luxury sedan with a hastily converted sports edition. Truly the most frugal definition of luxury... this thing felt old when it rolled out of the factory.

`Jura Forma`, heavy luxury sedan with pretty terrible mileage, unless the owner opted for the nuclear battery. It was voted "ugliest car of 2076" by the Interplanetary Authority on Vehicle Aesthetics. At least they tried something different!

Now we're talking. The `Jura Polaris` is a sleek luxury hovercar, one of the last designed prior to the Unexpected Interrupt. This was one of the few Union vehicles to actually be desired internationally and it's pretty obvious as to why: slim compared to most yoku-powered systems, fast, quiet, and comfortable.
