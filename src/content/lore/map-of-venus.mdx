`Venus`, commonly referred to as Venera, was a world known for its inhospitable environment. It was covered in a thick layer of alien jungle, and the native life almost seemed to be coordinated in their efforts to repel intruders.

That didn't stop the Greater Union, however. Not even close. Using armies of napalm-loaded robots and orbital climate control systems, the alien lands were slowly burned away in a process they called "terraforming". This process left behind soil so rich and a climate so perfect for growing any engineered crop that the planet became the breadbasket for the Solar System.

Beyond the colonized, purified territories of the Union and Pact laid the endless toxic swamp and jungle. Within these lands, great beasts and dangerous landscapes concealed incredible, ancient secrets.
