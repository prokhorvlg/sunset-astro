After months of resets and fine-tuning, nothing changed. Each time KASA-1 was instructed to design the new hardware system, the screen was a c i r c l e. The machine claimed the layout was far more efficient, and the humans would never understand.

Ultimately, the design firm was forced to produce the HUMUS Radial to satisfy the impatient investors. And to everyone's surprise… it sold incredibly well, especially among technology tinkerers.

Guess there's something to radial screens after all.
