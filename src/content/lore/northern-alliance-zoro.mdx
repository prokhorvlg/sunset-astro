This gunship relied far more on its electronic equipment than its armament. Loaded with just a single high-caliber autocannon, this helicopter instead relied on a fleet of `STINGRAY` neuromorphic robots to feed it with sensor imagery and to carry its weapons. This gave it unparalleled flexibility and protection for the crew, as the drones were placed into the dangerous situations the helicopter itself would otherwise face.

The second crewmember would serve as a coordinator rather than a gunner. This would have been a skilled technician trained in bot-based operation and strategy.

Eventually, most `Zoro` were retired from combat roles, often finding their way into search-and-rescue roles within civilian organizations on Mars.
