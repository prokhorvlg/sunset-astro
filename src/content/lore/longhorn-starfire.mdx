While the Space Race turned the Solar System into a hotbed of colonization activity, the Arms Race raged in parallel. Where nuclear bombs gave way to intercontinental missiles, and missiles were attached to the belly of enormous interplanetary rockets, the *screamer* was created as a solution for negating and intercepting weapons of mass destruction. 

`Screamers` were rapidly-launching spaceplanes designed around a single purpose: to deliver an anti-spacecraft missile, eliminating them before they could become a threat.

The `Longhorn B-18 Starfire` was one such aircraft. It came equipped with distinct sets of air-breathing engines (SABRE) and a nuclear-thermal rocket. Its designers drew inspiration from older Cold War aircraft designed around high-speed and high-altitude operations, such as the iconic SR-71 Blackbird and the NXR-5 Vibora.

The Starfire depicted here is equipped with 5 BP/AS anti-orbit missiles tucked under its belly. It is capable of safely re-entering the atmosphere from near-orbit, and can dock with interplanetary frames for re-fueling and travel. Different variations of the aircraft also saw usage as a spy plane, although satellites made this role rarely used.
