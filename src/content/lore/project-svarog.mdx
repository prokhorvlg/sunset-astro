Pictured are a number of documents related to the development of `Project SVAROG`, the Sunset Research Initiative’s first `Full-Scale Noetic Alteration System`.

While alteration prototypes effective at molecular scales were constructed by various parties for decades, the incredible amount of funding and international support permitted Project SVAROG to make huge leaps in practical applications of the noetic sciences.

Project SVAROG was designed to manifest small physical objects, but would often be used to test other effects as the Initiative increased its understanding of the noosphere.

While the cause of the spherical interference pattern in the photograph wasn’t known at the time, it was later understood that Murphy Interference was caused by the Altar’s unwillingness to be imaged. Special instrumentation would be developed in response to this and similar effects.

After the relative success of the project, over a dozen other minor and major Altars were constructed by the Sunset Research Initiative to varying degrees of success. It would culminate in `Project WHITE SERAPH`, a monumental space-based Altar designed to incorporate all noetic understanding.

**PROPOSAL**

It is proposed to continue the research into practical implementation of the noetic sciences. Studies will be performed using the device known as Project SVAROG, which shall be constructed at one of a number of possible locations, preferably remote.

Subsequentially, periodic and carefully monitored Noetic Alteration experiments will be conducted, beginning with the spontaneous manifestation of objects below 10 kilograms of mass and eventually culminating in the consistent manifestation of mass in the 100 kilogram range.

**Eugene Goff**
*Program Director*

**MEMO**

I-005, to be referred to as The Anima Incident, was caused after an unusual high-risk manifestation experiment was performed by the Project SVAROG team under direct instruction from Program Director Eugene Goff. 

Several hours later, reports of a mass-casualty event began to emerge from multiple planet-side sources. The Risk Control Team discovered a link between the “pandemic” and the high-risk experiment conducted within Project SVAROG. 

The Anima Incident was declared to be a SEV-5 internal emergency and immediately classified as management-only. At least several hundred non-personnel coma and braindeath incidents have been recorded as of this memo. A non-trivial percentage of native fauna appears to have been affected as well. It is estimated that the final extent of the collateral damage will be unknown for several years.

The Representatives hereby:
1.     Promote Alexander Olson to position of Program Director;
2.     Authorize the creation of “Rapid Response Team” to be lead by Agent Yusif Rasulovof Operation 253;
3.     Revoke the directorship of Eugene Goff.

Signed,
???

Imaging attempts failed to capture the nooscope, replacing the device in-camera with what is now referred to as the “Murphy” interference pattern. Film, digital, still-image, video, holographic, American-make, Soviet-make, Japanese-make devices were used. A total of 51 devices, all had similar results. Cause is currently unclear.

In response to this discovery Goff directed the creation of the Noetic Imaging Solutions Team to be lead by researcher Alexander Olson, with the mission of understanding the cause of the imaging failure and technological solutions...
