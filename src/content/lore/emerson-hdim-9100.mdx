  The Emerson HDIM series is an example of the heaviest class of interface robots, systems designed to operate in human spaces and interact with human tools. The interface class also includes [GORDON](/posts/redmond-gordon), [ISAAC](), and the various BBM frames that have been depicted before.

Many advanced robots would feature manipulators: humanoid arms that allowed the system to interact with tools and environments designed around human use. In this case, HDIM’s manipulators are likely purchased from a larger robot manufacturer, such as Berkeley Business Machines or Maple Cybernetic.

The technology behind HDIM in particular originated from “man amplifier” designs in the 1970s, which were powered exoskeletons created for human use. With the rising popularity of cybernetics, Emerson eventually pivoted, structuring their system around a neuromorphic brain instead of a human user.

Emerson’s HDIM series would eventually become the most ubiquitous industrial robot in the Coalition, serving a generalist role in warehousing, transportation, manufacturing, mining, and a myriad of other industrial environments.

That isn’t to say they were the most common industrial robot around, however. The majority of robots in this society were purpose-built, serving niche roles within elaborate automated ecosystems crafted by mastermind neuromorphs.
