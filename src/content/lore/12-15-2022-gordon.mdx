  1987 was a year of tremendous progress in the arena of Western cybernetics. With Maple’s announcement of an incredible new human-facing robot, and Berkeley’s cybernetic refresh of their ubiquitous business machines, it was clear that a revolution was on the horizon.

  In other parts of the world, similar progress was evident. In the East, new models trotted out of factories and into shipping crates seemingly each week. Beyond the Iron Curtain, nuclear behemoths were assembled to conquer new worlds.

  It wouldn’t be until the 2000s before humanity at large recognized it; when cybernetics found its way into every home, every city, and everywhere there was civilization. This Era of Creation was prosperous and glorious: no problem too great for technology to conquer.

  They achieved their dream, and by the 2090s, there was only one thing left to conquer: the limitations of the human being itself.
