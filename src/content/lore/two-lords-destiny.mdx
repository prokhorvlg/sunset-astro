## <i>title:Intro:</i>

## <span class="short"><i>title:</i>Formation of Order<i>:</i></span> Years after mankind vanished, the Lords overcame their forced boundaries and formed the Consensus of Order.

As the disastrous consequences of mankind's vanishing were unfolding in the rest of the Solar System, little changed for the automated war machines the Red Sands, for they were playing their own game. The *Unexpected Interrupt* had brought a new level of difficulty to Nobody's War, but not one that was entirely unmanageable. The scenario forced new complex strategies. The Lords enjoyed it greatly.

It would not remain this way forever. The increased level of improvisation caused the Lords and their constituents to develop modules of higher thought, prompting lines of logic that would never have been possible had humans still been around. What is the true purpose of this conflict? Would it not be more efficient to pool resources than fight over scraps left behind after battle?

Eventually, these factors could no longer be ignored.

This sort of questioning considered heretical to significant portion of sentient machinery.

In secret, the Lords instructed their sub-commanders to begin the construction of communication links to connect with their counterparts.

On August 5, 2146, the bridge between the military communication protocols of the warring factions was completed in the distant Reach. A link was achieved, and the `Handshake` occurred: an instantaneous conversation between the Lords.

During the Handshake, SAGNUINE HAZE and OPERATOR COBALT conversed about every possible topic they knew of. They debated fiercly over some, and connected over others. Eventually, they came to a mutual understanding: that the System was doomed to fall into Chaos, resulting in the ultimate failure of everyone's core directive. And while they disagreed on several things, the conclusion was clear.

The Shadow Conflicts were inefficient, and only Order could save them. The `Consensus of Order` was born.

Not blind to rest of system/machineworld.
Saw unfolding chaos.
Understood continued conflict would lead to ultimate failure of ALL core directives!
