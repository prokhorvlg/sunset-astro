### `Dr. Eugene Goff` 

Sunset's first and most ambitious Director served for nine years beginning at the inception of the organization in 2059. He spearheaded the creation of the first Altar, *Project SVAROG*, among many others. Under Dr. Goff, the disjointed science of noetics and the noosphere was condensed and organized into formal noetic theory. 

Dr. Goff's directorship was revoked by the Representatives after his involvement in the *Anima incident*, a [mass casualty event](/posts/project-svarog) triggered by a high-risk experiment.

### `Dr. Alexander Olson`

The organization's most cautious Director served for four short and fairly uneventful years. Since he originated in the *Pine Valley incident*, Dr. Olson's true origins or credentials could not be verified; at least not by traditional means.

Dr. Olson's directorship was revoked due to a lack of progress on the primary objective, despite his safer methods.

### `Dr. Marina Shevchenko`

Known as the Director-Engineer, Dr. Shevchenko's six years oversaw the largest strides in practical implementation of noetic technology. Her administration bootstrapped *Project WHITE SERAPH*, the Altar which would eventually be activated in 2095, among a number of other practical systems.

Unfortunately, her rapid-moving administration was marred with security flaws. Dr. Shevchenko was removed after an oversight caused *neurocasting technology* to be leaked to the outside world, leading to the implementation of a much more ruthless Director.

`Two more Directors served as head of SRI before the Unexpected Interrupt. They will be revealed at a later time.`
