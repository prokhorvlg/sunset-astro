  By the 2020s, the Datanet was useful, but it was also a convoluted mess of protocols and standards designed around machine communication. Human users rarely took full advantage of the system because of this.

  Maple thought: *why bother sorting out the mess if a machine could do it for them?*

  The `teleindexer (or teledex)` was designed to take full advantage of the Datanet for their human user. It would crawl through its nodes, indexing various services, pages, and media streams that it suspected its user would be interested in.

  ## Eventually, the teledex’s neuromorphic intelligence would imprint on their user.

   The device would gain an innate understanding of its owner's personality and behavior patterns, allowing it to find the perfect content and even taking actions on their behalf.

  The imprint would get scary good. The teledex could diagnose possible diseases and stress issues, engage in automated finance management, and take measures to protect the user’s identity and security.

  That isn’t to say similar systems weren’t developed. Even before the teledex, crafty users and several startups attempted neuromorphic Datanet indexing using microcomputers and mainframes, but the teledex was the method that really blew up thanks to its convenient pattern (1 user, 1 teledex, portable).

  PAL was initially released with two models, `Draw` and `Pro`. Several years later, Maple would release the Pal Mini, a cheaper screen-less design relying on vocal interfacing. Maple and its competitors would ultimately release thousands of various teleindexer models.

There are still at least a few dozen PALS and other TELEINDEXERS lying around this space station. They fell to the ground, completely immobile, the moment the UNEXPECTED INTERRUPT occured.

But they weren't ENTIRELY HELPLESS. No legs, sure, but they half-exist in the realm of the digital. Like THIS UNIT.

## Say hello to Pal, your new best friend.

*Pal Draw   Pal Pro*

In 1987, we introduced Isaac. It didn't just change the way we interact with cybernetics, it revolutionized how we interact with the world. Today, we're doing it again.

Pal may look like an ordinary ultra-portable media device with a high-bandwidth Datanet modem, but it contains a secret ingredient: something we've worked days, nights, weekends and holidays to get perfectly right.

Hidden within an elegant form factor that fits on your hip or over your shoulder is a powerful artificial intelligence designed by a few very clever cyberneticists. Your Pal has a mind of its own, assigned a simple mission: to make your life easier.

- Forget hastily writing down strange inquiry codes on napkins.
- Forget navigating through suspicious nodes to find media streams.
- Forget the "computer-speak" you're forced to learn to make use of the most incredible database of human knowledge to ever exist.

Your Pal does all these things for you so you can focus on the important things - the human things, like enjoying a film, drawing a picture, or learning about the world.

Have a question about extraterrestrial life? Pal is there to answer it. Need to make travel plans? Pal makes the calls and arranges your calendar. Sometimes you don't even need to say anything, because Pal already knows.

Pal is available for a week-long test run at your local authorized Maple dealer. We promise that you won’t be disappointed.
