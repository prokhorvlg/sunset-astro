H500 were commonly seen drowning in the swamps of Venus, earning it the nickname of Swamp Monster. Still available for the low low price of fishing one out of the bog, if one is willing to wrestle the composite crabs.

While the Shyrok BA-6 were not self-driving by default, aftermarket modifications like this over-cab robot were extremely easy to obtain and install.

Eventually, trains like this would become the standard off-world. On the upside, they were incredibly fast and required little infrastructure. On the downside, they were tremendously loud, unusable in settlements without good sound-proofing.

Designed for the deathworld of Venus. The weapon destroys native insects by knocking the bugs so hard that their insides liquify against their composite chitin exoskeleton. Sometimes, Archangel separatist groups "accidentally step into the line of fire".
