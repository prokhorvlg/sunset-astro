## It’s good to be the king.

It's no accident that the Kunshu has been rated as top economy car by the Noble National Listing* nearly each year since 2005. Through bitter storm, scorching heat, or caustic rain, it proves itself time and time again. There isn’t a single car on the market that can match the Kunshu’s reputation of reliability.

Don't let the affordable price tag fool you. This little machine packs a 450 horsepower atomic-electrical engine and the most advanced self-driving computing core in the system. Combined with the fact that it’s a Kasawi... it’s the obvious choice.

### Built for every world.

The only place our cars can't go is the vacuum of space. Whether you're cruising down a highway through the Martian sands, or braving Titan's rugged terrain, there's a Kunshu for you.

### Unbreakable.

Each model is built and tested repeatedly at the ERROT facility on Venus enduring the worst conditions in the Solar System. All Kasawi cars are designed from the frame to last.
