subText: "Union vehicle design was often rugged, practical, and simple, with hints of atomic-era futurism. Their vehicles can still be found in the millions across each living world with a Communist sphere."

### Altai Zhuk `2053, translates to Beetle`
> Compact Commuter Hatchback

*A simple car that transports you, three comrades, and several stacks of economic planning papers from office A to office B.*

### Altai Vorobei `2094, translates to Sparrow`
> Low-End Hover Coupe

*The common citizen of the Union will be provided with a hovercar by 2100. Perhaps not an elegant one, but it will hover, and they will not complain.*

### RAZ G200 `2048`
> Medium Transport Truck

*Smells like ethanol. We aren't sure if it's the truck or the driver.*
