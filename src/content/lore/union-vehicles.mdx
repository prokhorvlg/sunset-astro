An exploration of vehicle design from the Communist-sphere of the world. My goal was to hit a note of 1960s to early 1970s design and atomic-era futurism without going overboard, still slotting in within the overall cassette-futurist setting.

The exploration also forced me to consider the evolution of vehicles in the setting, for I had always treated them as somewhat static. The idea here is that over the century, vehicle design moves from "retro" to "retrofuturistic", ultimately culminating with the hovercar in vogue near the end of the human era in 2095.

The machine world roaming the world after is met with vehicles mostly from the 2050s forward, but older machines still remain. Vehicles are typically equipped with neuromorphs by the 2030s, which can drive the vehicle and maintain climate control, among other convenient features. Most of them never moved from their parked location, and wait for their owners to come back until their nuclear battery dies or natural events destroy them.
