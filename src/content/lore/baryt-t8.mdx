An export version of a Soviet microcomputer from the 2060s, when Coalition and Union relations began to warm after a decade-long standoff. Devices like this filled a niche that allowed Western users to access the Union's AGREGAT network, locked behind the KONTROL chip.

This system was one of the first steps on a long journey to bridge the Ternary Divide, which eventually allowed the free flow of information between the two primary dataspheres of the world.
