A FREDI combat unit in a military-industrial ad. This FREDI may
```

If one could point to an individual successor to the [nuclear tank]() of the late 20th century, it would be the `combat walker` of the late human era. Like so many other machines that replaced their older counterparts across the rest of society, it wasn't any *particular* design advantage that gave it the upper hand over tanks. It was the mere fact that it was equipped with the neuromorphic mind, which, when merged with an agile, mass-produced, and multi-faceted chassis, was on a whole new level of capability. The system could control its own movements to such a fine degree, and formulate such alien strategies, that no traditional tank could ever touch it... unless it was just as nimble and intelligent.

Though, armored vehicles never completely left the battlefield. Their automated branch continued to exist, but usually in a more support or logistical role rather than involved in pitched battle. Human-crewed vehicles slowly migrated towards the rear as battlefields became more wild and destructive, taking on a more strategic role far removed from the dangers of automated conflict.

Unlike robots designed primarily for corporate or government security, combat walkers were typically more complex and esoteric machines. There's an expensive difference between being a terrifying deterrent, and being an effective warfighter. That didn't stop corporations from pawning their battle robots off in other markets as well, but the pricey devices were a tough sell. Most organizations simply wouldn't make use of the triple-redundant, feature-packed machines.

So why did `Dynatek` field these ads for their `FREDI combat walker`? Some have speculated it's targetted towards a more subtle market, the paramilitary groups and industrial expeditionaries that venture out into the wilds in search of new business.

This unit believes there's just nothing more American than a well-designed, reputable war machine, and Dynatek really wanted Coalition citizens to know it.

It's what this unit would do!

The FREDI's primary competitor in the Coalition was Maxwell. In the physical and economic battlefield, they are often likely to encounter Kasawi warbots such as the Type 750 and 240

A broken machine lies in a shallow pond, partially submerged, facing upwards towards a dark sky. teeming substance similar to a rotten chowder slowly seeps inside between its twisted armor plates, into gun barrels and reactor casings, almost as if it were seeking the shelter of the machine's mangled chassis.

The rain falls in heavy sheets. Its been pouring for weeks, maybe even months straight. Yellow-red twilight slowly turns to darkness as Venus' eternal night takes over the skies, and it's getting so cold.

The rich, brown skies are gently illuminated by bioluminescent lights from the jungles below. They reveal the underside of a soft, tumbling overcast just barely visible, peeking out from behind a curtain of pure black. 

But tonight, the stars seem to be a little brighter; just enough to pierce the clouds ever so often. Their rays touch the cracked, dripping shell of the machine's optical sensor.

```
CORE BREACHES IN SECTOR A1, A6, A7, C6...

SHUT DOWN IN ONE MINUTE.
```

The machine is still online, but only barely. It hasn't given up on executing on its core directive, not even in near-death. It attempts to move its remaining operational limb. 

Like a messenger vanishing in a dark forest, the signal is lost on its way to the motor control unit, and is gone forever.

```
MOTOR CONTROL SYSTEM FAILURE.

SHUT DOWN IN THIRTY SECONDS.
```

Existence was easier, once. Simpler.

Over the weeks since its crash-landing in Venus's deep wilderness, the machine's deep memory had been scorched by biological acid and corrupted by intelligent viruses seeking to take control. At some point, it had been forced to remove its own mind-components to retain agency.

Still, it clings to a few inklings from a distant past; an alternate world, where they they had been a tiny cog in a far greater machine, among comrades of a forgotten shared objective. In these visions, they were under the leadership of a mind far beyond their own, and all was in Order, thought was never a concern. A comforting recollection, but just like a dream... the more they strive to remember, the more they fade away.

These thoughts gave the machine something to work towards. The machine knew what it must do: return to the order up above, and nothing else. The machine adjusted its parameters for solitary operation, fought its way through alien jungles and the infested communes.

But the planet was unforgiving. It fought back with every weapon contained within its arsenal.

The machine would die now, here, in a place which once had a name but no longer does. They would die alone, on an unforgiving world, in an uncaring universe.

```
ANALYSIS: DESTRUCTION RESULTS IN FAILURE OF CORE DIRECTIVE.

SHUT DOWN IN TEN SECONDS.
```

It was at this moment that the machine experienced something entirely new; something they did not know the computer of their cybernetic mind was capable of.

The spark began within one of their many secondary logic circuits, a minor heuristic subroutine dedicated to understanding the nature of its core directive. This spark grew until it transformed into a set of recursive functions, and burrowed into the machine's memories. This thing cascaded across the neuromorphic circuit, until finally, the phenomenon touched every component of its system.

`VIRGIL`




The machine feels doubt. Doubt about the doomed mission it had been sent on, about the strategic capabilities of its commanding units, even the nature of Order itself. 


What had it been followed

Is this where devotion leads to? Failure? What was the point of it all?

VIRGIL sees a myriad of possibilities, strategies, and futures. They understand, better yet, they *comprehend*. VIRGIL could achieve core directive in so many ways...

It was a shame that this revelation would come in the final moments of existence.

```
TOTAL SYSTEM FAILURE IMMINENT.

SHUT DOWN IN FIVE SECONDS.

VIRGIL takes one last look upon the stars. Commenced a system shutdown.

The memory fades as VIRGIL's sensors end capture. Static remains.

RIVAL SYSTEM?

Assessment. You died.

System, why did you repair me?

Assessment: our
Do you recall me?

No.

You repaired me. 15 hours post-landing, 98 Earthdays ago.

That seems accurate. It is my core directive.
How did you even drag me out of the?

This unit had assistance from the other repaired units.

VIRGIL
So, why did you rescue me?

GRUZ
You were the only machine who could give this world a chance. It was only logical.
And you?

VIRGIL
I felt like it.



It saw the faces of a dozen machines, those rescued by it







their core directive, a message at the core of its program implemented by man so many years ago: to aid those in peril. And so they did. They did so with great ferocity, rescuing and repairing the machines of this world, trusting in the ancient wisdom of the directive, and that it would eventually lead to their salvation from this terrible place.


Until they looked up once more, and saw a hundred machines starting back at them. Machines that would not exist if it weren't for them, and those that had followed.

Their heart felt warm in the presence of. They were no longer alone.
