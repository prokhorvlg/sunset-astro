If one could point to an individual successor to the [nuclear tank](/posts/bighead-tanks) of the late 20th century, it would be the `combat walker` of the late human era.

## <span class="short"><i>title:</i>Goodbye, traditional armor<i>:</i></span> Combat walkers eventually replaced the role of armored vehicles.

Like so many neuromorphic machines that replaced their older counterparts across the rest of society, it wasn't any *particular* design advantage that gave combat walkers the upper hand over existing armor. 

Really, it was the mere fact that it was equipped with the neuromorphic mind. When combined with an agile chassis with hundreds of control points, this cybernetic brain had access to far more potential strategies than that of a traditional vehicle. The system could control its own movements to such a fine degree and formulate such unusual tactics that no traditional tank could ever come close.

To put it a different way, the limited capabilities of a traditional vehicle (that is, moving forwards, backwards, sideways...) was perfectly suited to what a human crew was capable of controlling under most circumstances. A neuromorph, given full control over a vehicle and its every pivot and joint, was capable of competently controlling something much more complex.

Even so, armored vehicles never completely left the battlefield. Their automated branch continued to exist, but usually in a support or logistical role rather than directly involved in pitched battle. Human-crewed vehicles slowly migrated towards the rear as battlefields became more chaotic and destructive, taking on a more strategic role far removed from the dangers of automated conflict.

### Types of combat walkers

The automated military force of the late 21st century usually consisted of several types of robots.

- `Agile platforms`, typically bipeds such as the *Dynatek FREDI* or the [Kasawi Warmaster 750](posts/lazarus-warwalker), would sprint across the battlefield to deliver critical strikes at opportune moments.

- `Stable platforms`, quadrupeds or hexapeds such as the quadruped [Kasawi TUK 240](posts/ryujin-and-toshi-setting-out) or [Maxwell Stonewall](posts/two-lords-cobalt), provided heavy firepower and armor in strategic choke positions.

These would be escorted by a large number of armed drones and interfacers, and supported by occasional artillery and air strikes.

## Advertising? Why?

Unlike robots designed primarily for corporate or government security, combat walkers were typically more complex and esoteric machines. There's an expensive difference between being a terrifying deterrent at a high-security facility, and being an effective warfighter. That didn't stop corporations from pawning their battle robots off in other markets as well, but the pricey devices were a tough sell. Most organizations simply wouldn't make use of the triple-redundant, feature-packed machines.

So why did `Dynatek` field these ads for their `FREDI combat walker`? Some have speculated that the ad was targeted towards a subtle market, the paramilitary groups and industrial expeditionaries that ventured out into the wilds in search of new business. Most likely, it was meant to impress policymakers and generals within Heavenbreaker so that the Coalition would spend more of their budget on building more of these machines instead of the Maxwell competition.

This unit believes there's just nothing more AMERICAN than a well-designed, reputable war machine, and Dynatek REALLY wanted Coalition citizens to know it.

It's what THIS UNIT would do!

In the wake of the formation of the Consensus of Order, many war machines have become friendly with one another regardless of their manufacturer or country of origin, though this is not a universal truth. Dynatek's rivalry with Maxwell robots continues mostly in the form of light jabs at each other's capabilities.

# <i>:hide:</i> NOT JUST WAR.

## <i>:hide:</i> You'd expect Dynatek to build the world's best land-air-space combat system...

Case in point, the CA-18 FREDI. A multilateral unit which can be dropped from orbit directly into battle at any point on Earth, Titan, or Mars in less than a minute. It digitally links with Dynatek mainframes and aerospace units to perform perfectly synchronized strikes against its targets. (One operator tells us that a FREDI once singlehandedly extricated three Maxwell walkers five times its own mass under continuous fire.)
It's the best combat walker in the world, and it's keeping watch over you.

## <i>:hide:</i> ...but would you expect us to conduct rescue missions in the Arctics?

We're designing all sorts of machines to operate in the harshest conditions found in the Solar System, from dynamic walker units to climate-controlled habitats. Today, over twenty terrestrial and orbital research stations on Earth, Titan, and Mars rely on Dynatek systems to keep researchers and visitors safe. Including the CA-18 FREDI.

## <i>:hide:</i> ...or build the most advanced orbital-class space station in the System?

In 2059, the Sunset Research Initiative approached us for our experience in off-world construction experience. Since then, engineers at Dynatek have worked closely with the Initiative scientists to construct the most complex, massive superstructure ever designed: the Inner Eye Orbital. This next-generation space station will host the world's next generation of noetic technologies.

We can't wait to tell the world about what we've been cooking up!
