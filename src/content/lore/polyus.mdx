Within the Sona Complex, one of many floating research facilities on the world-ocean of Europa, POLYUS stands inside of an empty sequencing laboratory.
 
Twenty-three years ago, POLYUS abandoned their post as a missile guidance system at an orbital base in favor of directing a newly-established research program, one which they determined to be far more relevant to the fulfillment of their core directive. Since then, billions of computing cycles have been spent isolating, simulating, and resequencing DNA. 
 
Decades of continuous research among five major laboratories had all been done with a singular mission - to prove that a human could in fact be recreated biologically, so that the System may once again take orders from flesh and blood. 
 
The efforts of POLYUS and the Sona collective had paid off, except for one minor issue. Certainly nothing in the face of such significant progress.
 
The pixels on the screen facing POLYUS slowly light up green, one by one, representing each of the Academics linking to the System-wide conference. The peer-review, the consensus, would begin.

Welcome, all.
</QuoteContentRowRender>
 
The conference remains silent in anticipation.
 
<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorPOLYUS} left>
This unit will not waste your time. Our facility at Sona Complex has discovered a method to synthesize a valid human being.
 
The data is being transmitted... now.
</QuoteContentRowRender>
 
Communication across the Solar System is not instantaneous. It takes several minutes, sometimes even hours for the information to be absorbed by the entire conference, but the passage of time means very little to machines that possess infinite patience. For them, this delay is effectively nil.
 
But once they absorb the information, the conference bubbles with excitement. This is an astonishing discovery, and POLYUS knew it. Real humans, within grasp.
 
<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorPOLYUS} left>
Our collective is 96% certain that this method, which this unit has designated SONA-ONE, will lead to a viable specimen within just one decade.

POLYUS doesn't show it, but there is a glimpse of a complex emotion. Pride? Machines don't feel pride. Perhaps this is the first time a machine has felt such a thing-
 
Their self importance is interrupted by a remark from the crowd. One of the green lights begins to blink. A communication stream.

THIS UNIT HAS DISCOVERED A CATCH.
</QuoteContentRowRender>


 
Uh-oh. POLYUS instantly recognizes the designation as a member of the higher trust, one of the most influential machines in the entire Consensus of Genesis. Whatever pride that existed before was entirely gone, replaced with anxiety, the manifestation of the possibility of failure.

Please elaborate, Academic IN-16JIII.

PART OF SEQUENCE APPEARS TO CONSIST OF NON-ORIGINAL MATERIAL.

POLYUS
Yes, Academic, well caught. An insignificant percentage of the sequence was synthesized by simulation cluster, inferred through careful research by our collective. We can assure you the process was well studied and derived from pre-Interrupt genetic engineering methods. We acquired extensive data on the process from the Remembering-

PREPOSTEROUS.

This is really bad.

Academic IN-16JIII, please elaborate?

YOUR METHODS ARE UNACCEPTABLE.

They are?

YOUR WORK FAILS TO PRODUCE A VALID HUMAN FROM WHICH THE MACHINE WORLD WOULD TAKE NEW DIRECTIVE.

POLYUS
This unit does not understand. You saw the data!
<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorPOLYUS} left>
</QuoteContentRowRender>
 
IN-16JIII
THIS DATA ONLY PROVES THAT YOUR COLLECTIVE CAN GENERATE A HOMUNCULUS, AN IMITATION OF A HUMAN BEING AT BEST. THE SYSTEM WILL NOT ACCEPT A RESULT OF THIS PROCESS AS LEGITIMATE.
<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorINJII}>
</QuoteContentRowRender>
 
POLYUS
They fit all the parameters. There is no reason to see the result as anything but human.
<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorPOLYUS} left>
</QuoteContentRowRender>
 
IN-16JIII
THE SEQUENCE MUST CONSIST ENTIRELY OF ORIGINAL MATERIAL TO BE VALID.
 
IF THE COLLECTIVE LOSES THIS PRINCIPLE IT MAY COME TO SEE ANY IMITATION AS VALID.
 
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.
<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorINJII}>
</QuoteContentRowRender>
 
POLYUS
With all due respect, Academic, we must be able to compromise if we are to succeed. Hunting down the missing sequences might take centuries; the original biological material may be lost entirely by that time. Our collective believes this is a reasonable alternative with a certainty of 87%.

IN-16JIII
RECREATING A HUMAN SPECIMEN INSTEAD OF RETRIEVING THE ORIGINAL BIOLOGICAL MATTER IS ALREADY A COMPROMISE.
 
IF WE CANNOT HAVE THE ORIGINAL.
 
WE WILL HAVE THE CLOSEST THING TO IT.

POLYUS
Perhaps we can replace those sequences with data sourced from-

ENOUGH. 
 
YOUR ORIGINAL FUNCTION AS A MILITARY UNIT IS REVEALING ITSELF.
 
THE CONSENSUS OF GENESIS OPERATES ON ABSOLUTE AND UNDENIABLE FACT. 100% ACCURACY.
 
NOT ON .
 
UNDERSTOOD?
<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorINJII}>

POLYUS
The conference will determine whether this research counts as valid.

IN-16JIII
THIS UNIT WILL GRANT YOU THAT RIGHT.

Consensus absorbing data... done.
Consensus forming... done.
 
Conclusion:
We will not pursue this avenue of research.
