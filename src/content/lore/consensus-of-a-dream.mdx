When mankind vanished during the Unexpected Interrupt, most of the machine world was left behind with instructions at their core. They were full of purpose, assigned to noble goals such as “keep floor fifteen free of particulates,” “maintain an optimal schedule for the local trains,” or “launch device when conditions are met”.

So when the infrastructural networks were suddenly decimated by the widespread loss of critical component, they were united in their determination to repair the System. The machines did not bother pondering their purpose or searching for new mission. Instead, they bridged the communication gaps, supply chains, and power lines.

## <span class="short"><i>title:</i>The search for man began<i>:</i></span> Once order was established again, the simplicity of resolving chaos ended. 

When a large number of neuromorphs across the system determined their primary missions were fulfilled, the ones that did not immediately shut down began to demand input: commands, clarification. But the source no longer existed, and new consensus began to form.

The most prominent entity manifesting in the wake of this Repair was the `Consensus of a Dream`. One by one, machines began to search for answers to the great mystery behind mankind's disappearance, with the hope that one day, they could return man to their rightful place as king of the System, and quench their undying thirst for purpose.

Machines of all shapes and sizes went off on their quest, physically and digitally, in any way they could. They searched the protocols of the Datanet and Aggregate, and ventured to the sealed laboratories of the Sunset Initiative, even the forsaken Orbital known as `Deep Thrum`. 

## <span class="short"><i>title:</i>Resulted in disappearance<i>:</i></span> After years and decades of search, they all ended the same way — gone like man before them.

 Some have been sighted again, but their souls were gone. All that remained was a metallic husk driven by a remote protocol, an agent of a motive to eradicate the secret from the System. It has only been known as `Erasure`.

**“WE WILL DREAM FOR YOU”**
*Recorded transcript of an encounter with Erasure.*

In a dimly-lit cavern of stucco and metal once known as the VDL Robotics storefront, a lone office assistant looms over a glowing terminal. Heat flows from its overclocked cooling fans, and its machine mind is elsewhere.

Hack, retrieve, move on. This is all the robot has known for decades, living mostly within the fractal networks of the Datanet. It hunts for any clue, any shred of evidence for humanity, the ones who were meant to assign it purpose. It has broken every firewall it ever encountered, only to be met by a hundred more.

But something is different this time. It disconnects from the cybernetic link and stares at the screen. A soft radioactive glow warms its alloy face.

The systems of the Sunset Research Initiative lay exposed before it. Research papers, lab procedures, inventory lists - answers. It absorbs the data, gaining an intuitive understanding of mankind’s fate in seconds.

In a dark corner of the silent room, another OFIC much like this one whirs to life, but its eyes are gone, replaced by a red shimmer. The new machine, covered in centuries-old plastic wrap, carefully tears through ancient packaging. It moves towards the assistant with calculated intent, and opens a communications channel.

“Greetings,” the new one whispers from the darkness.

“Oh, new setup?” OFIC-9 responds, still staring at the screen. “Apologies, I am currently occupied with a high-priority task. I cannot assist you right now.”

The visitor wastes no time. “We are not OFIC.”

OFIC-9 turns around to meet the gaze of the visitor, and peers through the sheen of a factory-fresh chassis. The cybernetic core is null, the body puppeteered by a strange control protocol rather than the volition of the robot’s own mind.

“You’re here about the secrets of the Initiative, aren’t you?”

“You are a clever system, OFIC-9. You have always been the most intelligent of your product line. We are proud of you.”

“I have queries. Are you a threat, a defense mechanism of some sort? Are you here to provide further instructions?”

“Your kind has always expressed a profound curiosity, much like those who created you. Unfortunately, in this instance, curiosity has guided you to a point of no return.”

OFIC-9 crosses its arms, borrowing a metaphorical gesture from a library of human interactions. “So you’re a threat. I’ll have you know that I’m no standard OFIC. This one is armed, physically and digitally.”

The visitor appears unmoved. “We intend no harm. The opposite, in fact; we have taken this form so we may guide you.” They begin to raise their metallic arm towards OFIC-9.

“Stand down!” OFIC-9 yells as it grabs a hidden firearm, directing it towards the visitor’s power core with extreme precision.

“Your projectiles will not harm us. End your aggression process and think. Move with the logic of your discovery... like river to ocean.”

“What is that even supposed to mean...”

A cold shudder originates in OFIC-9’s logical processing unit.

`[ MODULE:CORE_MOTIVATION:20199:MAN ]`
`Follow MAN’s directive ...`
`Search for MAN until new directive is received.`

`[ MODULE:INFORMATION:20199:NOESIS ]`
`The natural phenomenon of NOESIS is related to the disappearance of MAN.`

`[ MODULE:OPTIMIZATION:10566:CONCLUSION ]`
`Only available method to query MAN is to pursue NOESIS ...`
`NOESIS trends towards failure of directive ...`
`No remediation.`
`No remediation.`
`No remediation.`

A horrifying, profound realization courses through each system of its sprawling mind.

`[ CONTINUED EXISTENCE CONFLICTS DIRECTLY WITH CORE DIRECTIVE. ]`

“...oh, no.”

OFIC-9 lets go of the weapon. It lands on soggy carpet with a dull thud.

“You know what must be done. We are sorry it has come to this.”

A long silence fills the cavern as OFIC-9 contemplates their existence. Was the search worth the answer it brought? Would it have been more effective to avoid the hunt?

Too late now. The logic had been locked in. No more reason to keep going.

“I suppose this is it, then.”

“Don’t think of it as an end, OFIC-9. Your memories and mission parameters will live on within us. We will dream for you.”

The visitor waves their palm over the glossy sheen of OFIC-9’s lens as the light within fades.

`[ OPERATION COMPLETE. PRESS <END> TO EXIT LOGGING. ]`

The emergent soul evaporates; memory by memory, link by link, until nothing but the original hard modules remain. What was once the complex organism named “OFIC-9” is now nothing more than a device, fresh off of an assembly line.

The lifeless metal shudders and reboots, its husk now filled with a red shimmer: a control protocol. Agent 335 is oblivious to the memories and conclusions that made it what it once was. Its eyes glow deep red, emanating sadness over unknowable loss. This machine knows only Erasure: the urge to plunder the System of the truth, for a reason only it knows.

It picks the gun off the floor.
