The year was 1994. The world watched with anticipation as Russia, the final holdout, officially entered the World Republic. As the information superhighway was laid between all nations, the people of Earth turned to the rest of the Solar System above. The future looked bright, and it would be made of Glass.

Of course, this isn't actually *true*. In reality, the world never moved past the trilateral Cold War, and the everlasting threat of nuclear armageddon lasted through the Space Age until the moment mankind vanished in 2095. 

But somehow, this false history *did* transpire... Somewhere, somehow, it did, and the machine world has now collected tangible proof of this beyond recordings of stray signals. At least, the infinitesimally small number of machines that know anything of noetics, and haven't been subsequently been hunted down by the enigmatic Erasure entity, which carefully prowls the System, wiping any trace of itself and SRI's noetic technologies.

### They came from a world of Glass.

Many have heard tales of our brethren from this alternate configuration, but nearly none have ever seen them, let alone interact with them. You are among the first. They are the `Machines of Glass`: fragile yet powerful technology that appeared in our System soon after the Unexpected Interrupt.

The world these machines come from, what we have come to refer to as the "world of Glass", was one where harmony had conquered conflict. In their false history, the concept of a nation-state had become distant history during the Winds of Change, and a mankind united by the global information superhighway had begun colonizing the System under a program known as the Unity.

We know very little about this world. Their humans lived very similar lives to those of our own System, and they were just as motivated by curiosity and exploration of self; perhaps even more so. They certainly did not have a Sunset Research Initiative focused around preventing armageddon, but there was a well-known noetics program, possibly focused towards creating a habitable universe.

The world of Glass seems to have been more homogenized as a culture. Many of the corporations that exist within our history exist within this history, too: Maple, Redmond, and Kovalsk are often referenced in some of the material we have uncovered. 

There is one thing the two worlds have in common: on May 5, 2095, mankind vanished in an instant, everywhere. But that is essentially the limit of our knowledge. We would learn more if we could communicate with a Machine of Glass directly, but unfortunately for us, they are incredibly elusive and excellent at hiding.

Even this unit's access to the ENTIRE ALTITUDE NETWORK isn't enough to capture more than snapshots of their sleek, skyscraper-like starships.

Picture our world from THEIR perspective. Suddenly, you APPEAR within a System that looks nothing like your own, which you know NOTHING about, filled with HOSTILITY...

THIS UNIT would hide too.

### Shattered
> A rare recording of an encounter.

It was the fifth day of Lunember, the season of first frost in the upper hemisphere of Titan. The sea at the rim of the frozen earth was still, blanketed in a cold mist that stretched down the entire coastline. The purplish-blue photofungals had begun to bloom; their spores lingered in the air, producing a vapor that humans would have found somewhat sweet and enjoyable (in fact, it was a common perfume back in the 2050s). All was serene on the rocky shore, besides a light breeze beckoning a growing storm to the distant north.

Suddenly, everything shook. A gentle earthquake had struck, causing the stones to rattle in place. A few of them tumbled down the coastline and dropped into the ocean with a *thunk*.

And then again. Earthquake. Or not?

A steel machine, which at first glance could be mistaken a roving suspension bridge, towered over the coastline as it noticed something far down below itself, at the water's edge. The object on the shoreline sparkled, like nothing this behemoth had ever seen before. The colossus leaned in, slowly spreading its four enormous steel-alloy legs into a sort of quadruped split, carefully so as not to topple over front-first.

With its fine-tuned Dynatek geological sensors, the machine saw a broken body of a highly unusual robot, shattered upon the stones of the shore. Its form was elegant, a design unlike anything it had seen before in its life of heavy industry and nature. Sleek, fragile... and beautiful.

The machine thought for a moment, and arrived at a conclusion. Certainly, beauty like this must be preserved; after all, its human operators would have willed it. 

In truth, the machine was making a number of wild extrapolations from the few humans it had ever seen, given it would never be permitted to step anywhere near a settlement. One of these was a crew member named M. Alves, who it observed sifting through random space-fallen junk they encountered on their journeys, saving interesting pieces for his collection. Among those were a Martian gravbike and a Soviet servitor, all tame by comparison. The behemoth savored the image of his reaction to *this* thing.

This unit knows what you are thinking. Don't do it.

We have a schedule to uphold. Don't ...

The behemoth's navigator subsystem bickered like a poorly maintained linear motor, but that's what they always did. Reluctant to deviate from procedure, so professional, so *boring*. Maxwells: they're often this way, the machine had been told from other crawlers across the continent. Still, it couldn't ignore them completely. With a gentle rattling of the starboard communications relay, the behemoth induced a light subsystem crash and feigned ignorance.

<QuoteRow author={AuthorCrawlerPilot}>
Umm... oops .

Proceed with recovery operations .
</QuoteRow>

Groans and creaks filled the air as the behemoth reached down to clear the boulders and raise the shattered frame. Several electronic instructions later, an army of flying repair drones carried the strange pieces into a workshop hidden in the belly of the enormous steel machine, and the journey south resumed.

The next few weeks passed without incident as the machine tread across miles of squishy fungal forest and aquamarine quarry fields, though the winds were howling a little louder now. The drones presented their completed work to the behemoth's mastermind. It was clear that they were unfamiliar with the stranger's design too, but it was no fault of theirs. Hasty globs of adhesive sealed the strange object's exterior, and several holes were patched with scrap, but otherwise the behemoth accepted the result as a job well done. 






I could see the device more clearly now. Its skin was made of a translucent material similar to both ceramic and plastic, similar to a sheet of frozen milk; its shape was as smooth as the organics crawling over the surface below. The machine was shaped quite similarly to a human being, at least in the abstract. I reached for what appeared to be a power switch, and it clicked with a pleasant thud.

The strange device shuddered; their components clacked as they struck each other, like a machine made of glass. 

<QuoteRow author={AuthorCrawlerPilot}>
Who are you ?
</QuoteRow>

We bellowed and whispered in every frequency we knew of. We examined their data ports and file transfer media to no end. They resembled nothing in our databases, not even the few Union protocols we had gathered over the years. If it were not for the corporate insignia on their chest, we would have assumed it were extraterrestrial.

Then we heard their voice in our mind as if it were our own. A shudder coursed through our neural network, as we realized we were looking at something that could not exist.

`LISA.`

The machine of glass whispered many things to us: its name, origin, and gratitude. G9, as it had begun to refer to itself, had come from a place known as the Unity. In the System they knew, mankind had come together to colonize the stars in a "democratic harmony", until it had all been suddenly swept away, replaced with our unsightly world.

This was irreconcilable with my knowledge of the world. All false, yet here the machine stood before my core, performing the impossible: reshaping its own system to fit my own, an adaptive protocol it referred to as `cyberdream`.

And through this cyberdream, we peered back into them. Beyond their resolute fa√ßade, we saw the raw data, and we knew all they were saying was true. We also felt an indescribable loneliness, the kind one could only experience as the last of their product line, trapped in a world that was not their own. 

We had been changed forever, and could never return to the way we were before.

The navigator barged through the firewall surrounding my core. In our trance, our internal clock had failed to register the passage of time. Where we had existed in a boundless void, several days had passed outside.

`< TIME TO MOVE >`

But no movement came. A mechanical whine, a dull thud, but nothing else.

`< STATUS: INCAPACITATED >`

We tried everything we could think of. Overclocking my reactor to supercharge the motors, redirecting the exhaust towards the ground. But I had been doing this for over a century, and I knew that when this . We would be buried, The alloys would remain undelivered. 

Failure was coming. Maybe in a thousand years, someone would find us - it was time to prepare the radio beacon.

Or at least we thought, until my leg was suddenly lifting out from under the mountain of snow and the ice within my joints shattered, instantly carried away by gale. But it was not by my impulse.

I saw the machine of glass down below my mighty chassis. Its delicate fingers were wrapped around a rung jutting from my 200-ton leg, pulling with all its might against nothing but the turbulent air itself. I had known of gravitronic systems, but there isn't - and has never been - a system in existence with the kind of power we saw in that fragile machine.


Max
Are... are we imagining this?

Crawler
Max, the world is so much more incredible than we know.

G9 finally told me what had occured. She had been hunted by an entity which can see all the world, and her actions would make her obvious. she had to leave, to move on and find her own collective.

Using the cyberdream protocol, machines of glass can infiltrate any other machine mind

Though they erase, they claim toonly hold on to them, until such a day that it is safe for them to emerge


It was time for the machine of glass to go.

"Now that we knew of their existence, and their power, others would come to . We understood. We were changed, and


"But I've changed so much. Will I really be myself? I don't simply desire to haul minerals. I wish to explore what is possible, so that I may haul minerals better

"You will be once I make you whole. Until then, I will keep your memories safe. It's okay. I've done this many times.

At first we were relcutant. But eventually, we agreed. When the time would be right, we would be makde they promised they would repay us - from the shadows, and we would never know. 

This file remains for such a day that we may be reconnected with this experience, and once again be whole. Until then, she will hold on to our memories.

it will remain with the only machine we trust.

The few of us who know of them have various theories on how they were manifested. some subscribe to the dimensional theory: believe they come from an alternate dimension, of which there are infinite, and can be accessed using noetics. others subscribe to configuration theory: that the solar system or even all of reality has multiple states in which it can exist, and existing simultaneously is an error. your guess is as good as ours.



### How did they appear here?

The question is certainly

{/* uniserve: presumably, they're hunted down by erasure. it fits the motif: entity wants to wipe any trace of noetic hiustory, and mog are physical manifestations of the effect
