### Shattered
> A rare recording of an encounter.

Their broken body lay deactivated among the stones of the cold southern shore, shattered into a hundred pieces. It was an elegant form, a design beyond anything we had seen before within our world of heavy industry. Certainly, beauty like this must be preserved. They would have willed it so.

The navigator disagreed, figuring. They were a rather reluctant type to deviate from procedure, as Maxwells often are.

Against the recommendation of my navigator, we reached down with our entire mass to clear the boulders and raise its shattered frame. The repair drones were instructed to perform their duty, as we proceeded with ours.

Soon, the drones presented their completed work. They were just as unfamiliar with the stranger's design as we were, but it was no fault of theirs, as they had been trained on machinery like ourselves. Besides hasty globs of adhesive sealing its exterior, they had done a fine job. We could see the device more clearly now. Its skin was made of a translucent plastic, similar to a sheet of frozen milk; and its shape was as smooth as the organics crawling over the surface below.

We switched it online. The strange device shuddered; their components clacked as they struck each other, like a machine made of glass. 

`< WHO ARE YOU? >`

We bellowed and whispered in every frequency we knew of. We examined their data ports and file transfer media to no end. They resembled nothing in our databases, not even the few Union protocols we had gathered over the years. If it were not for the corporate insignia on their chest, we would have assumed it were extraterrestrial.

Then we heard their voice in our mind as if it were our own. A shudder coursed through our neural network, as we realized we were looking at something that could not exist.

The machine of glass whispered many things to us: its name, origin, and gratitude. G8, as it had begun to refer to itself, had come from a place known as the Unity. In the System they knew, mankind had come together to colonize the stars in a "democratic harmony", until it had all been suddenly swept away, replaced with our unsightly world.

This was irreconcilable with my knowledge of the world. All false, yet here the machine stood before my core, performing the impossible: reshaping its own system to fit my own, an adaptive protocol it referred to as cyberdream.

And through this cyberdream, we peered back into them. Beyond their resolute fa√ßade, we saw the raw data, and we knew all they were saying was true. We also felt an indescribable loneliness, the kind one could only experience as the last of their product line, trapped in a world that was not their own. 

We had been changed forever, and could never return to the way we were before."

`TIME TO MOVE.`

The navigator barged through the firewall surrounding my core. In our trance, our internal clock had failed to register the passage of time. Where we had existed in a boundless void, several days had passed outside.

`< TIME TO MOVE >`

But no movement. A mechanical whine, a dull thud, but nothing else.

`< STATUS: INCAPACITATED >`

We tried everything we could think of. Overclocking my reactor to supercharge the motors, redirecting the exhaust towards the ground. But I had been doing this for over a century, and I knew that when this . We would be buried, The alloys would remain undelivered. 

Failure was coming. Maybe in a thousand years, someone would find us - it was time to prepare the radio beacon.

Or at least we thought, until my leg was suddenly lifting out from under the mountain of snow and the ice within my joints shattered, instantly carried away by gale. But it was not by my impulse.

I saw the machine of glass down below my mighty chassis. Its delicate fingers were wrapped around a rung jutting from my 200-ton leg, pulling with all its might against nothing but the turbulent air itself. I had known of gravitronic systems, but there isn't - and has never been - a system in existence with the kind of power we saw in that fragile machine."


Using the cyberdream protocol, machines of glass can infiltrate any other machine mind

Though they erase, they claim toonly hold on to them, until such a day that it is safe for them to emerge


It was time for the machine of glass to go.

"Now that we knew of their existence, and their power, others would come to . We understood. We were changed, and

At first we were relcutant. But eventually, we agreed. When the time would be right, we would be makde they promised they would repay us - from the shadows, and we would never know. 

This file remains for such a day that we may be reconnected with this experience, and once again be whole. Until then, it will remain with the only machine we trust.

## What are the Machines of Glass?

The Machines of Glass. Many have heard of these, but few have seen them. They are a number of machines

The world they come from was one of harmony. Where in our reality the Cold War persisted, in theirs, the creation of the information superhighway and lead to the collapse of the official nation-state. The Winds of Change of the 1990s

In this world, there was no Sunset Research Initiative, but there was a noetics program: one focused not on preventing Armageddon, but creating a habitable universe. Though, globalization lead to a much more deeply homogenized culture, and a united humanity.

All the companies and organizations that exist here exist there too. Maple, Redmond, Kovalsk. 

Their quantity is unknown to the machine world
