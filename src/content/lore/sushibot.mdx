Despite resembling a Pact-designed robot with its Daguist triangular motifs, the robot is faux Japanese. It was actually built by a Coalition company in Saturnian orbit. Its role is very similar to that of a food truck, in that it provides a varied lunch experience for the office workers at remote office locations, such as the wilderness of the outer Solar System.

Over a century after the Unexpected Interrupt, the sushibot continues to endure halalbot's antics, waiting for the opportunity to serve a customer that will never come.
