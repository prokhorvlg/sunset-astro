Affectionately nicknamed by one of the botanists it worked with, `ü•î KARTOSHKA` has been Greenhouse 10's caretaker for 109 years, 9 months, and 10 days. The last scientist it ever saw triggered its specialized genetic research routine, so that is what it has been doing, without question, since it was initialized. It will patiently continue to maintain its experiment until a Union scientist with clearance level C reassigns or decommissions it.

Over the years, increasing containment failures of the Institute of Agriculture have forced KARTOSHKA to enact an emergency protocol. Out of necessity, the machine has ventured far beyond its designated perimeters to recover replacement parts for itself and the equipment surrounding it.

During one of these journeys, KARTOSHKA recovered a dormant patrol drone and rebooted it, driven by an impulse it did not understand. It reasoned that the drone was to assist it with maintaining the laboratory, but there was something more influencing the logic circuit. The impulse could not be traced to any specific instruction, module, or error code; it could only be described. 

```
SHELL EXPERIENCES DANGEROUS LEVEL OF PRESSURE BUT ATMOSPHERE REMAINS NOMINAL
SHELL REQUIRES ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE BUT SHELL DOES NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE
SHELL SEEKS BUT DOES NOT HAVE PROGRAMMED TARGET PARAMETERS
```

And so, `üç© BUBLIK` was initialized to keep KARTOSHKA company.

As KARTOSHKA grows older, its artificial mind continues to wander. Is it these strange faults within its logic that caused it to effectively continue its work where the other units failed? Is there a greater purpose to continuing with its experiment if no one will ever collect the result? Self-diagnostics have revealed these thoughts to be caused by hardware degradation. Hopefully, a lab assistant will soon wake up and replace the faulty sector.
