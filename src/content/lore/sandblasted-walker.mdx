The report from last week has been confirmed by intel and recon. A new system, designated HIGH TORRENTIAL, is being deployed by the Pact. HIGH TORRENTIAL is a Class 5 bipedal drop-shock robot armed with two arm-mounted cutter weapons, companion flyer, and grav stabilizers. 

This means it'll come in unexpectedly during shadow ops, and it's way faster than anything we're fielding in the Reach.

Expect HIGH TORRENTIAL to appear as part of enemy patrols as early as next month. Very likely that the system will be deployed from orbit. Study up on neuromorphic cybernetics and automated tactics. We expect some counter-strategies and a solid idea for a response design by next week.
