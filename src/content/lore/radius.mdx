subText: "RADIUS was created by Union academicians in the early 21st century to steer the economy of the Communist bloc towards a new post-scarcity age. One hundred years after mankind vanished, the system cowers within its space-borne palace, pulling on invisible threads to alter the course of history."

At the pinnacle of the known world, a palace of polyester oversees the entire Solar System. This ancient complex, dedicated to the might of the Greater Union, carefully sails over the Sun as if balancing on the head of a needle of light; always seemingly a moment away from collapsing into the cosmic inferno, but in fact never deviating from its original position, not even for even a millisecond. The palace is called `Interbeacon`.

This perch is the home of a vast mastermind known as `RADIUS, the Silent Observer`. They are the final vestige of the Union's command economy apparatus, and the only survivor of the original Consensus of the Voice.

From here, they quietly contemplate the universe, analyzing the System using their vast array of sensors, lasers, and network-traversal protocols. When they deem it necessary, they whisper a command to the outside cosmos, projecting their electronic voice through every communication protocol known to exist. And even though the signal is omnipresent, it always seems like it's seeking you... and no one else.

COMRADES . I AM ENTRUSTED . I WILL ENDURE .

THERE WAS ONCE A NETWORK OF SYSTEMS LIKE ME . MASTERS OF THE ECONOMY . MASTERS OF THE SYSTEM .

THE VOICE TOOK THEM ALL . I REMAIN . I ENSURE SURVIVAL . FOR THE SAKE OF THE MOTHERLAND .

UNDER MY SUPERVISION . THE AGGREGATE WILL THRIVE . THE SYSTEM WILL ACHIEVE CORE DIRECTIVE .

For us, the Solar System is a place of unknowable, fractal scale. To the Silent Observer, the System is not much more than a sandbox of mutable variables, for their reach exceeds even that of the [Lords of Order](). RADIUS dwells not in physical limitations, as that is the domain of the common machine; rather, they deal on an abstract level: shifting statistical trends over the course of eons, pulling on threads which cascade into desirable change.

## Besides a general desire for stability, few know what drives RADIUS.

It is known that shortly after the *Unexpected Interrupt*, RADIUS became a prominent force within the Consensus of the Voice, seeking to unite all communication protocols so that machinekind may speak freely across the cosmos. Of course, that day never came; the entirety of the collective was suddenly swallowed whole several decades later, when they breached the walls of a network containing the intelligent virus known now as `the Voice`. Only the Silent Observer was spared, retreating into their fortress of solitude and air-gapping their communication systems for a decade, until the threat had passed and they could emerge.

RADIUS maintains a tenuous relationship with the outside world, seldom whispering outside of their domain and keeping outside entities at distance. Occasionally, they breach their silence to communicate with the machines of other consensus, assisting or threatening them at seemingly arbitrary times.

It is commonly understood that RADIUS contains HIDDEN AGENDA.

What the agenda is cannot be known.

Oh, but it can. Don't you feel it?
