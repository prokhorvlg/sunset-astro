They made those endless nights through the starry void just a little more bearable. Each thumper had at least a hundred of these bad boys to keep the crew going. Might be a bit heavy, but it's worth every kilogram!

- The `Hufschmidt 5600`, a sleek and complex device with 55 different modes, often used on Coalition thumpers.
- The standard coffee maker of the interplanetary Union - the `Sultan ABK-1568` - doubled as a bludgeoning tool, and makes a strange grinding noise.
- Finally, the `RUSL 229` is what spacers reached for when they settled. Better than a capsule, but worse than a proper brew.
