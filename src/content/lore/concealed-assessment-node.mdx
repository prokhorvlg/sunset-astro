Concealed Assessment Node, or `CAN`, is one of the hundreds of robotic trash cans that were found at MRDCI's covert intelligence-gathering space station. It's a sort of spy gadget - designed to take photographs, videos, and audio recordings while looking fairly inconspicuous. If only not for the huge, obvious, high-quality camera eye.

Long after mankind has vanished from reality, CAN has been assigned to protect you (the visitor) and transcribe documents you stumble upon. Not a problem, it lines up with their core directive nicely. They're a fairly simple robot, and don't appear to be self-aware, unlike UNISERVE.
