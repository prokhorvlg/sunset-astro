Following the invention of the neuromorph by a Soviet cyberneticist in the 1970s, forays into traditional human-computer interaction seemed to stall. With robots being actually possible, society at large placed more attention on the development of robots, and their potential to replace the need for microcomputers entirely.

Their assumptions were wrong. Microcomputers were forced to advance in tandem with cybernetic systems: processing power, storage mediums, and display technologies would improve drastically. Peripherals including the mouse, trackball, subvocal, and neurocaster came to facilitate improved personal interaction. Datanet/Aggregate-based software would connect microcomputers across the starry skies. 

*The general form factor of the modern microcomputer would remain a wild west of technology design, always a decade away from inevitable retirement.*

  A myriad of wonderful FORM FACTORS, a nightmare for SOFTWARE ENGINEERS. ESPECIALLY radial monitors.
