  On May 5 2095, anything that considered itself human vanished from the Solar System. This event would come to be known as the *Unexpected Interrupt* by the machine world left behind, the instant after which new orders from the creators ceased to be entered. It is the transition point between the spectacular *Era of Creation*, and the silent *Era of No Input*.

This is a pamphlet from the `Sunset Research Initiative`, a colossal international program tasked with solving the issue of impending nuclear doomsday and human conflict using technological means. What they discovered and constructed isn’t even fully understood by machinekind for reasons that will be revealed in a different exhibit.

The Initiative’s mission appeared noble, but their origins are shrouded in mystery. Most sources point to the Initiative being the result of efforts by rival covert agencies from the Soviet Union and United States, who – upon making a great discovery that changed their understanding of the universe – overcame their ideological differences to work together on something greater than themselves.

# SRI
*Sunset Research Initiative*

Since 2059, the Sunset Research Initiative has studied posthuman concepts that fundamentally change the scientific community’s understanding of consciousness and its effect on the universe. Our scientists work in collaborative units to generate technologies that transcends ideology, political division, or individual motive. We aim to deliver a future in which each and every member of mankind can flourish. 

To preserve the integrity of our core mission, we strongly believe in discretion with regards to our methods and discoveries. Please enjoy this educational pamphlet to learn more.

*The Sunset Research Initiative is sponsored and supported by all major nations.*

# Nuclear armageddon is coming.

In the 1990s, scientists in the Soviet Union and United States of America created the first full-world simulation systems, supercomputers which would eventually come to be known as prediction engines. Designed with the intention of predicting various futures, such as a likely winner in a total nuclear exchange or the trajectory of the human race in the Solar System and beyond, prediction engines were expected to reveal exciting new possibilities for the human race.

Instead, these systems revealed an unfortunate statistical likelihood which would continue to be confirmed even as the technology improved. Society is converging towards a doomsday: a technological cataclysm that would end the world as we know it, widely understood to be caused by nuclear exchange between ideologically opposed peoples.

Despite the incredible technological achievements our society has accomplished, the inevitability of annihilation had been proven.

*“Uh-oh! The end of life as we know it as a button press away.”*

# We’re going to stop it.

*The Input Data Sanitization Team at Project BELOBOG.*

*“No worries, we’re on the job!”*

The Sunset Research Initiative is an international organization created to research technological solutions to human conflict. The organization consists of several hundred participating laboratories, offices, and stations across the Solar System. Participating facilities must closely adhere to the SCI security protocol to ensure the integrity of the core mission.

Within the Initiative, our scientists study posthuman concepts, such as noetics: the study of consiousness and its effects on the natural world. Noetic projects are expected to produce a universal-scale solution by the end of the century. For more information about the Sunset Initiative and its projects, please download one of our resources on the Datanet or Aggregate network.

# You can be a dreamer too!
