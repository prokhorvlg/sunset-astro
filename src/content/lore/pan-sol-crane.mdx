Designed for the Coalition military by the *Bowen Company* in the early 21st century, the `Crane 850 ULTRA` served as a reliable heavy hauler for many decades. These spaceplanes would attach to thumpers to make their trek between worlds.

As the orbiter aged, many were sold off to major airlines. These Cranes found new life as passenger liners, as their colossal interiors made for fantastic flying hotels during interplanetary voyages that could last over two weeks long.

Their water-landing capabilities made them useful in remote ocean regions with no spaceports, and its immense scale combined with the ground effect to make ocean travel efficient and easy.

Cranes continue to fly even after man’s disappearance, following schedules set by transportation masterminds such as Pan Sol’s `GIGAPLAN`. They are primarily found in the waters of Titan and Europa.

Met the guy several times. GIGAPLAN remains self-absorbed, like most masterminds. This unit DOUBTS they even noticed mankind's disappearance.

**When you board the Crane, you won't want to leave.**

We understand that a trans-planetary voyage can be a strange, unpleasant experience.

That’s why Pan Sol will be the first interplanetary airline to fly the Crane 850 ULTRA from Bowen Company, an orbiter so large and luxurious that it might as well be a cruise liner.

Come join us at the front of the Crane to enjoy a deluxe first-class section, complete with movie system, lounge, and bar.

Near the drive, a selection of cozy economy cabins almost the size of a luxury suite provides you with the option to travel in style for a fraction of standard cost.

Within the center of the spacecraft are a world-class restaurant, shopping promenade, and recreational facility with space-grade swimming pool.

So next time, why don’t you try Pan Sol Airways?

**PAN SOL**
Solar System’s most experienced airline
