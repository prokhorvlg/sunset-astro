The 1980s would become a new Gold Rush for the nations of Earth, rushing to claim and make use of the newly found ecosystems

The Soviets were the first to Venus, shipping out systems such as this RAZ-







Designed in the early days of Venusian colonization of the 1980s, RAZ-G1105 such as this one would spend months in the swamp-jungle wilderness, cataloguing millions of fascinating alien species and collecting samples in their trusty mobile terrarium.

Machines like this and their human operators were known as *gene harvesters*, as the samples and compounds they collected would become the basis for a number of biological breakthroughs. These included an engineered corn which grew on Venus as quickly and effectively as a weed, a gene therapy that annihilated cancer, and an emergency injection that would trap a dying human brain in a sort of preservative stasis.

## Centuries later, not many have survived.

The Unexpected Interrupt spelled doom for many of Venus's jungle robots, trapped in a hostile and rapidly-growing environment which seemed to be hell-bent on erasing any signs of human civilization from the planet. This one, designated SHROOMY for a highly-advanced and nuanced reason that only mastermind machines could comprehend, appears to have survived somehow.

Finding its way to surviving regions of Venus and eventually travelling to other worlds, SHROOMY has become a valuable member of the Consensus of Genesis. Their ultimate goal is to bring back man through cloning or other medical processes, using the remains of man's advanced genetic engineering technology.

Rather than seeking and cataloging new species, SHROOMY's new mission is to locate any viable trace of the only species that ever truly mattered to machinekind: homo sapiens. Most of their time appears to be spent in graveyards and medical facilities, where human biological material seems to be most abundant.
