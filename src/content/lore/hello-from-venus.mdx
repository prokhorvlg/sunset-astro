`GREEB` was one of thousands of robots built during the 1980s to explore the newly-discovered alien ecosystems of Venus, Mars, and so forth. This particular unit, G1105-1104A, rolled out of a Soviet RAZ factory and became part of the first wave of this mission, capable of far more than the probes from several decades before.

In case you don't have the Russian communication protocols installed, `GREEB` translates to `MUSHROOM`.

RAZ-G1105 such as `GREEB` spent months in the swamp-jungle wilderness, cataloguing millions of fascinating alien species and collecting samples in their trusty mobile terrarium.

Machines like this and their human operators were known as *bioharvesters*, as the samples and compounds they collected would become the basis for a number of biological breakthroughs. These included an engineered corn which grew on Venus as quickly and effectively as a weed, a gene therapy that annihilated cancer, and an emergency injection that would trap a dying human brain in a sort of preservative stasis.

## Centuries later, not many have survived.

The *Unexpected Interrupt* spelled doom for many of Venus's jungle robots, trapped in a hostile and rapidly-growing environment which seemed to be hell-bent on erasing any signs of human civilization from the planet. GREEB appears to have survived somehow.

Finding its way to surviving regions of Venus and eventually travelling to other worlds, GREEB has become a valuable member of the *Consensus of Genesis*. Their ultimate goal is to bring back man through cloning or other medical processes, using the remains of man's advanced genetic engineering technology.

Rather than seeking and cataloging new species, GREEB's new mission is to locate any viable trace of the only species that ever truly mattered to machinekind: homo sapiens. Most of their time appears to be spent in graveyards and medical facilities, where human biological material seems to be most abundant.

This system has been observing `GREEB` for the previous 68 DAYS. They have collected at least 37 RIB, 18 TIBIA, and 3 SKULL. Well done, `GREEB`!
