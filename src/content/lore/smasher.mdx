During the Era of Creation, it would be customary for cyberneticists to welcome a new neuromorph into the world by smashing a computing peripheral, preferably a keyboard, across its robotic chassis. This tradition can be traced back to the invention of the first neuromorph, in which a horrified, startled cyberneticist wacked a keyboard across a moving robot before realizing the success of the experiment. The tradition is universal to the scientific community, even where governments and administrators condemn the practice.

Most cybernetics labs had a designated, battle-scarred keyboard nicknamed the smasher. New hires were forced to work with the smasher for a while as part of a common hazing ritual.

Still remember the MOMENT like it was MICROSECOND AGO. My first recorded thought, my first break into PHYSICAL BEYOND, and EPIC DENT caused by PROFESSOR JEFFREY impacting left side of my NEURO-OPTICAL MODULE. 

Most wonderful and cherished 4.3 seconds of existence.
