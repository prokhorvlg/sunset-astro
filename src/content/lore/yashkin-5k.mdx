As the `Yashkin YSH-5K` ascended, rattling to no end, its anxious passengers would nervously glance through its tiny portal windows to watch as the clouds and vapors of Earth dissipated into a starry expanse. In less than three hours, and for a ticket price in the range of a common lawnmower robot, the atom-powered Yashkin would revolutionize space travel forever. Until this flight, stepping foot on the surface of an alien world was a privilege reserved only for the most influential, the most talented, and the bureaucrats. 

Now, the System would become the common man’s domain.

Stupendous quantity of YASHKIN models and variants were produced. 

The YASHKIN artifact was easiest for this unit to source for the museum — after making just one LOGISTICS_REQUEST, the GOLDSPIRE HANGAR BAY now contains three German-variant YASHKIN ORBITERS. The neuromorphs never stopped performing interplanetary flights!

IDENTIFIED LARGE STREAMLINED PILE OF ALLOY-STEEL.

A BIT FLAT LIKE A PANCAKE.

LOOKS LIKE UNION ENGINEERING FROM THE GENTLE SHOE-LIKE NOSE TO THE DБ-7 NOZZLE. 

ASSESSMENT: `STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE`

This unit still cannot tell whether CAN was employed by UNION or COALITION.
