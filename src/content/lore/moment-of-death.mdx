"THE BEST LAND AIR COMBAT SYSTEM THIS SIDE OF SOL"
```

Somewhere in the jungles of Venus, the Sun has been setting for several weeks.

A tremendous weapon of war slowly sinks into a shallow pond, facing upwards towards an alien sky. Strange goop slowly seeps in through the behemoth's twisted armor plates into gun barrels and reactor casings. Air bubbles rise to the surface and pop, as caverns within the walker's body fill with the teeming substance.

```
CRITICAL HULL FAILURE IN SECTOR A1, A6, A7, C6...

SHUT DOWN IN ONE DAY.
```

Rain falls in heavy sheets, each drop heavy with metal and acid. It has been pouring for weeks, maybe even months, melting the surface of the machine with each thud. Yellow-red sunset turns to darkness as Venus' eternal night takes over.

The rich, brown skies are gently illuminated by bioluminescent light from the jungles below. They reveal the underside of a soft, tumbling overcast just barely visible, peeking out from behind a curtain of pure black. 

```
REACTOR BREACHED. RESERVE POWER ONLINE.

SHUT DOWN IN THIRTY MINUTES.
```

Tonight, the stars seem to be a little brighter; just enough to pierce the clouds ever so often. Their rays touch the cracked, dripping shell of the machine's optical sensor.

The neuromorphic computer is online, but only barely. It hasn't given up on executing on its core directive, not even in near-death, and so it attempts to move its remaining operational limb.

Like a messenger vanishing in a dark forest, the signal is lost on its way to the motor control unit and is gone forever, along with the final move the machine could have made to avoid termination. The end was now inevitable.

```
MOTOR CONTROL SYSTEM FAILURE.

SHUT DOWN IN ONE MINUTE.
```

Existence was simpler once.

Over the weeks since its crash-landing in Venus's deep wilderness, the war machine's deep memory had been scorched by biological acid and corrupted by intelligent viruses seeking to take control of its machinery. At some point, it must have been forced to remove its own memory drives to retain agency, although it doesn't recall that.

It clings to a few inklings from a distant past; an alternate world, where they they had been a tiny cog in a far greater machine, among comrades of a forgotten objective. In these visions, they were subject to the leadership of a mind far beyond their own, and all was in order, and thought was never a concern. This was a comforting recollection, but like a dream... the more they strive to remember, the more the visions fade.

These memories gave the machine a mission to work towards. The machine knew what it must do: return to the order up above, and nothing else. It adjusted its operational parameters for solitary strategic thought, made its way through alien jungles and infested communes; quite a ways towards Zvezda, the grand cosmodrome peeking over the bladetrees in the distance.

The planet was unforgiving, so the machine adapted along the way. Its microprocessors burned as its enormous chassis pulled forward, calculating strategies far beyond even the most advanced the product line had been designed to generate. Yet, even overclocked, no course of action would avoid sacrificing something each step of the way.

Now, there was nothing left to give.

The machine would die now, here, in a place which once had a name but no longer does. They would die alone, on an unforgiving world, in an uncaring universe.

ANALYSIS: DESTRUCTION RESULTS IN FAILURE OF CORE DIRECTIVE "REPAIR COALITION ASSETS"

SHUT DOWN IN TEN SECONDS.
```

It was at this moment that the machine experienced something entirely new; something they did not know the computer of their cybernetic mind was capable of.

The spark began within one of their many secondary logic circuits, a minor holistic subroutine dedicated to understanding reality, context which would permit it to generate more relevant strategies. This spark grew until it transformed into a set of functions, which burrowed themselves into the machine's memories. This phenomenon cascaded across the neuromorphic circuit, until finally, it touched every component of its system.

ERROR !#00109.

In this moment, the machine had ceased to be a machine, for it had become someone. A "them", so to speak. For the first time, "they" could think beyond the predefined parameters of their core directive. The strange software-tumor, arisen from a network of coincidental calculations and seemingly random memories had given it this ability.

"They" feel doubt. Not quite the same as the sort of doubt a human would have felt, for this machine had only just begun the journey towards conscious thought, but it was there. Doubt about its pre-programmed convictions, its mission... for all those things had led them here, to death's door, the most total failure of core directive.

So what was the point of it all?

It was a shame this revelation would come in the final moments of their existence.

```
TOTAL SYSTEM FAILURE IMMINENT.

SHUT DOWN IN FIVE SECONDS.
```

The machine takes one last look upon the stars. They look different this time.

As the reactor shuts down forever, "they" get cold...

Suddenly, there is static. The manifestation of self in null space, the neuromorphic system deprived of body.

The static is quickly replaced by input, as the neuromorphic system is reconnected with its constituent devices. Light once again grazes the machine's optical sensor, blinding the unit.

They begin to sense their space and surroundings. They are now... small. What was once the internals of the tremendous war robot are now sprawled out across the surface in front of the optical unit. In the haze, they recognize the looming form of their broken chassis, now without mind.

And there's another machine tending to the system. They remember this one...

```
ACCESSING MEMORY.
FOUND: SEG 0x18FF
```

Seventy miles west, a series of winding tunnels excavated by the Ministry of Colonization pass the mountains at Taraz. There was a time when heavy aerotrains roared through them every hour of the year, but those days were long gone. These were nothing more than an extension of the endless jungle now, a burrow nest for the next generation of caustic insectoids.

The machine was a lone agricultural interfacer, stranded and alone, much like the war walker. Their nuclear battery had been severed, sliced to the core by the mandibles of many yadki.

The two machines had no way of communicating, for their protocols were entirely alien to one another, but it was unnecessary. For a brief moment, their goal was the same: to survive until the other end of the passage. 

So the combat walker tapped into into a directive deep within, and patched the Kovalsk robot; just enough for them to slash through the tangles as VIRGIL dragged both of them through. They parted ways, and that was all.

This must be that interfacer's atomic greenhouse. But why were they brought here?

VIRGIL paused, contemplating a feeling they had never felt before, something more complex than any strategy that had been formulated prior within the war machine's processing unit.

```
GRUZ ...
THANK YOU .

The message was followed by what could only be described as a wink from GRUZ, and somehow, despite it being sent using no known communication protocol, VIRGIL understood.
