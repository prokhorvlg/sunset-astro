Venus is the breadbasket of the Solar System, so its climate was incredibly well-studied and controlled by weather rays. The planet operates on a 243 Earth-day cycle, which is the length of its day - several weeks longer than its year. As such, the Venusian calendar was based entirely on the length of its day rather than the year.

Such an extraordinarily lengthy day-night cycle created a fascinating ecosystem based around the night-year, as entire jungle forests keel over and fall asleep in preparation for the dark season, while night-beetles rise from their holes to stalk and consume their hibernating prey.

To counteract the brutal psychological effects of living in near-perpetual daylight or darkness, the Union created scheduled migration systems based on prevalent traditions in Eastern Europe. 

Venus was littered with small countryside communes in the sanitized regions of the planet. Within the commune, a sanatorium facility acted as a center for medical and recreational services to surrounding dachas (vacation homes). The complex acted as a logistical and military hub for the commune as well, armed to fend off native swarms and capable of hosting search-and-rescue operations.

During the night-year in major cities, families traveled to their assigned dachas on the opposite side of the planet to experience sunlight and pleasant weather conditions. These communes were typically left abandoned and unguarded during the night-year, so... try to catch the shuttle back.
