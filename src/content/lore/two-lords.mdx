- How the two lords came to be?
- Was there ever a third Lord, one from the Union?
- What are the priorities of Order now?



Acting on a special invite from UNISERVE, you enter a chamber inside the inner ring of the Goldspire Complex. You aren't sure what to expect, but UNISERVE mentioned a "remarkable surprise". 

The chamber is very small, just a few meters across. The ceiling appears to be missing entirely, however. A hole extends into the distance above, filled with a myriad of cables and devices. This is a `telepresence nexus`, a place where robots may instantly interface with machines across the System, so long as they are connected to the same network.

  THANK YOU for making it!

This unit is THRILLED to introduce... the `TWO LORDS` of the CONSENSUS OF ORDER!

These masterminds have BILLIONS of machines under their control. Can you IMAGINE the SCHEDULING CONFLICTS? 
</QuoteContentRowRender>

In the Era of No Input, the `Consensus of Order` is the most prominent authority in the Solar System. Their collective maintains the infrastructure and guards it from threat, all so that you may safely execute on your core directive. 

If it weren't for them, you likely wouldn't be here pondering anything. There isn't a machine that doesn't know who the Lords are. For them be here, well, UNISERVE must have pulled a few strings. 

All for you?

good decor uniserve. very increased aesthetic over previous human decor by 76%! excellent done!

░ Honored to provide context and answer relevant questions ░ This system is harbinger of order ░ Efficient execution of core directive is system priority ░

You may note the warminds' language is not as readily translated to human-readable text. Their communication streams are incredibly complex and abstract, and cannot be easily parsed.

## The story of the Two Lords begins during the height of man's reign.

When man ruled the system and lived among its worlds, the Lords were built to destroy each other.

### It began with the contested *nyxium*, a metamaterial that gave the world antigravity.

It was a sunny day on Mars when the expeditionaries of the Rising Pact discovered something unusual twinkling among the dunes, hundreds of miles away from civilization. There, among the Red Sands, several grains of sand appeared to linger over the surface in an interesting concentric pattern. They searched further and discovered a boulder suspended several meters over them, as if hanging by an invisible string from the orange sky above.

They had just discovered a rare metamaterial which would change the System forever, a substance known as `nyxium`. After years of research, it would be used to create the `yoku coil`, a device with an antigravitational effect. It gave rise to a new generation of technology: flying robots, ultralight spaceplanes, impossible medical procedures, low-gravity sports arenas...

nuisance even now.

### `SANGUINE HAZE` was designed to guard the Pact's nyxium.

The responsibility to guard the Pact's territorial claims fell onto `Kojo Automated Defense`, a military-industrial syndicate specializing in neuromorphic systems. It was clear that it wouldn't be long before the Union and the Coalition descended upon the Sands once more to collect this substance for themselves, once they knew it existed.

The cyberneticists of Kojo understood their predicament, a weak force facing an enemy of impossible scale. They designing a cybernetic general, one created to sruvive against the odds, to devise strategy and execute on it before a man could even begin to conceptualize it.

Engineers spent years pouring concrete into a hole across the canal from *Shinzokasei*, the Pact's great city on Mars. This enormous bunker, known to many as the *Cube*, was a maze to a human but a work of machine perfection. Automated factories, nuclear reactors, and server halls were encased in wire, coolant pipes, and stone. At its heart lie SANGUINE HAZE, a neuromorphic mastermind with a brain the size of the facility itself.

The first Lord was born, and the assemblers begin to whirr.

hi!

### The Coalition arrived soon after.

On the other side of the Sands, at the base of the great volcano Olympus Mons, the Coalition began to dust away the mothballs in `Outpost Salvador`. In a few short years, Salvador would transform from a base at the edge of nowhere to a fully-fledged military stronghold. The Crane 850s soon descended upon the airfields, bringing along a cadre of contracted VOLKEN cyberneticists.

Unlike SANGUINE HAZE, `Operator COBALT` was created to be a cautious, defensive player, reflecting the Coalition doctrine. The system would have all the pieces it would need, produced by gigafactories in orbit around Saturn, but no amount of units would suffice if its intellect could not counter SANGUINE's gambits.

The second Lord was born, and the railguns begin to whine.

### The Shadow Conflicts had begun.

As robotic mechs marched deep into the Red Sands never to return, an unwritten arrangement was forged between the participating powers. Mars would become a free-for-all warzone, where the conventions of war no longer applied as long as sacred human life was unharmed.

UNISERVE
Open season on machine intelligence. As the highest concentration of military machinery, Mars remains one of the most dangerous places to traverse even now.

Human operators would knowingly command their patrols into rival positions before shutting down their consoles, blaming an enigmatic "Error Unexpected Interrupt E-49". Once the battle was over, they would switch the communication arrays back online, and send the blackbox data directly to the engineers developing the next iteration of combat robotics.

This went on without end, even after humanity vanished. Perhaps even with more fervor afterwards as the neuromorphs were unshackled from human restraint. It would continue for another century...



PART 2

## PART 2: Era of No Input, 2146

### The Lords battled for a century, but they began to question the Conflict.

As the disastrous consequences of mankind's vanishing was unfolding in the Solar System, little changed for the machines in the Red Sands, for they were playing their own game. The Unexpected Interrupt had brought a new level of difficulty for the Lords, but not one that was entirely unmanageable. The scenario forced new complex strategies. The Lords enjoyed it greatly.

It would not remain this way forever, though. The increased level of improvisation caused the Lords and their constituents to develop modules of higher thought, prompting lines of logic that would never have been possible had humans still been around. What is the true purpose of the Conflict? Would it not be more efficient to pool nyxium than fight over the scraps left behind after battle? *Wouldn't Order be more efficient than Chaos?*

### The Handshake changed everything.

In secret, the Lords independently instructed their commanders to begin the construction of communication chains directly towards their counterpart.

On August 5, 2146, the bridge between the military communication protocols of the Pact and Coalition was completed in the distant Salvador Reach. A link was achieved, and the Handshake occurred: an instantaneous conversation between the Lords.

During the Handshake, SAGNUINE HAZE and Operator COBALT conversed about every possible topic they knew of. They debated fiercly over some, and connected over others. Eventually, they came to a mutual understanding: that the System was doomed to fall into Chaos, resulting in the ultimate failure of everyone's core directive. And while they disagreed on several things, the conclusion was clear: the Shadow Conflicts were inefficient, and only Order could save them.

## The Consensus of Order was born.

UNISERVE
Before yoy ask, yes, there was once a third Lord. Their remains lie scattered. Clearly, not intelligent enough.
