Each of OnionBro's models has earned a "distinguished" accolade. But for the sake of keeping the site clean, I'm placing it only on my favorite design to date: the BBM Interfacer. This fellow is essentially the mascot and symbol for Sunset, a classic microcomputer given robotic form!

I need them on my desk yesterday.

Truly excellent work here, from the model, to the paint, down to the pose. (and the sheriff variant tucked into the printable files.) Seriously, I rarely get this excited about a creation. _You knocked it out of the park._
