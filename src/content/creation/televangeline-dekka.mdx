DEKKA's design is GORGEOUS and unconventional: two things we appreciate *a lot* over here. Everything about this is SO COOL.

(This unit would distinguish EVERYTHING televangeline has contributed, but that would use up too many ACCOLADES, which are made of an EXTREMELY RARE isotope of PROMETHIUM. We are attempting to locate more.)
