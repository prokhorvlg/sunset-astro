Though not EXPLICITLY part of Sunset System, this robot conveys many of the qualities one might expect from our universe. Perhaps they're from a PARALLEL DIMENSION?

(Eggnogo's work greatly inspired [Ruby](/posts/redmond-ruby), and in turn Sunset System inspired this piece! How wonderful! If you're into robot design and enjoy Sunset, you should take a look at their other art too.)
