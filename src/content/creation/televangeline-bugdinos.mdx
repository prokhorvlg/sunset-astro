ALIEN LIFEFORMS are something we don't see often here - but *really should*. Venereal Megafauna is a genuinely fascinating and thought-provoking contribution to the EXHIBIT.

YADKOSAURS (named post-creation) are encountered in [this story](/posts/moment-of-death), inspired by televangeline's contribution!
