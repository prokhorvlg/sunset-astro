A LINEMAN WITH NERVES OF STEEL

A *raging* forest fire.
A *burning* office complex. 
A *collapsing* mineshaft. 

There is no situation too hot for the Brumhauer *Firelynx* to handle. 
Designed with the durability and quality you’ve come to expect 
from any Brumhauer product, the FLX model line is built to brave
even the most extreme of operating environments. 

Equipped with a state-of-the-art *Pyretex* h590 Fire Suppression
System, a rugged chassis, all-terrain omnitread technology, and
multi-stage internal cooling, the *Firelynx* is able to operate in
environments that would render other robots inert. Designed
with human psychology in mind, the *Firelynx’s* cool demeanor is 
fit for all firefighting and rescue operations, no matter how dire
the operation is. 

Designed for compatibility, the *Firelynx* is built with modular parts 
and hardpoints compatible with all other *Lynx* models, allowing
greater customization to fit your organization’s needs. Whether
it’s a single fire sentry for your office, or an entire brigade for
your neighborhood, the *Firelynx* is always ready to serve.

YES, another rare Pan-bot! 

It's so exciting to see your work every time. Always a fascinating, unusual, thought-provoking concept, thorough underlying worldbuilding (because of course the robot needs a full marketing piece), and just darn pretty. Fantastic work!

Now I want to use totally-not-Grumman...
