Their journey had taken them to countless places. 

Many of them were dangerous. There were the automated wargrounds, still crawling with antique battle robots scanning for fresh prey. When they got past those, there were the sand serpents, prowling underneath the dunes and swallowing machines whole. They survived, barely.
 
 Others were awe-inspiring, such as the cynosure towers - ancient communication hubs, soaring like blades from the sand. Or the ancient canals, scars across the surface of Mars so wide they could be seen from orbit. The memory of them would be forever etched into the crystalline platters within their minds.

But none were so *strange* as this one. For the truth is, a moment ago, this place didn't exist.

So... how did we get here?
</QuoteContentRowRender>

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorTOSHI}>
Instantaneously.
</QuoteContentRowRender>

They found themselves inside of an industrial tunnel. To their back, a concrete wall solemnly stared back at them. Ahead, a passage stretched deep into nothingness, submerged in an ocean of deep darkness.

The only hint that this place had once been inhabited by humans were a series of words etched into a sign.

```

We dream - for you.

SUNSET?

What is this place?
</QuoteContentRowRender>

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorTOSHI}>
Perhaps, the answer you were looking for.
</QuoteContentRowRender>

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorRYUJIN} left>
My risk subroutines are engaging;

Something about this place is wrong.
</QuoteContentRowRender>

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorTOSHI}>
WE ARE PREPARED. ONLY OPTION: MOVE FORWARD.
</QuoteContentRowRender>

And so they did, like they always have. Deeper into the nothing, for many silent, tense minutes. The corridor turned several times, but there was no other path.

Until finally, the tunnel opened up into a larger chamber. Still no light, so they used TOSHI's military sonar to see. Chairs, some shelves, and a microcomputer sitting upon a desk.

But not a spec of dust or sand. RYUJIN leaned in to examine the floor.

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorRYUJIN} left>
This is highly unusual.
</QuoteContentRowRender>

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorTOSHI}>
agree.

Logic dictates there would be maintenance staff, yet there is not a single neuromorph.
</QuoteContentRowRender>

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorRYUJIN} left>
Perhaps they left?
</QuoteContentRowRender>

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorTOSHI}>
remain under me, little one.
</QuoteContentRowRender>

The computer was an old Dynatek Terminal/21 - somewhat out of place for the Martian sands. The device was still connected to power, and linked to a local network.

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorRYUJIN} left>
Finally, something digital.

But I do not possess the necessary protocols to interface with this machine.
</QuoteContentRowRender>

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorTOSHI}>
...
</QuoteContentRowRender>

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorRYUJIN} left>
Oh, right.
</QuoteContentRowRender>

RYUJIN sat down as a human once would have, and poked the power switch with their slender metallic manipulator. Several seconds later, the machine blipped and whirred back to life after a century of silence. An image emerged onto the screen. The emblem of SRI, followed by...

```

You were right;

This is the place I was looking for.
</QuoteContentRowRender>

As RYUJIN tapped away at the device, digging through long-forgotten archives of data, TOSHI towered over their goblin-sized companion. Their head, a mountain of sensors and radios, ticked and rattled as the system rotated in place, slowly analyzing the surrounding chamber.

They felt it all - the vibration of the fans, a hard drive clicking, and the deep thump of a keyboard depression. Three large doors in each direction away from the desk, light rays originating from the screen bouncing across each of them, the air current sweeping in from under the gaps. They've become quite adept at this now. 

And TOSHI formed a conclusion. A feeling. An anomaly in their cybernetic mind?

No. It was subtle, but it was there. A perturbance in the physical, and an anomaly within the electromagnetic spectrum.
