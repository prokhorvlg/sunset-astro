The journey had taken them to many places. Many were dangerous - like the automated wargrounds, still crawling with antique battle robots scanning for fresh prey. Others were awe-inspiring, like the Cynosure towers, ancient communication systems soaring like blades from the sand.

But none were so strange as this one, the place that all their findings converged on.

They found themselves inside of a perfect tunnel. Beyond perfect, really, it was so seamless that even their meticulous machine vision could not detect a seam. It was as if the entire complex were cast from a single pour of pure tetradite alloy, the sort that once fetched astronomical prices on the interplanetary market.

The only sign that this place had once been inhabited by humans were a collection of words plastered over the walls:

```
Sunset Research Initiative.
We dream - for you.
Sarcophagus DELTA
```

[ My risk subroutines are tingling; ]
[ Something is not right here. ]

\<\< WE ARE PREPARED. ONLY OPTION: MOVE FORWARD. \>\>

They moved down the corridor and are met by a chamber with a welcome desk. Still nothing. Not even dust.

[ It is entirely devoid of neuromorphic systems; ] 
[ This is highly unusual. ]

\<\< AGREE. >>
\<\< LOGIC ANOMALY: NO MAINTENANCE STAFF. >>

[ Perhaps they left? ]

They examined the terminal.

```

Meanwhile, as RYUJIN, TOSHI senses an anomaly in the network. Something shifts in the darkness. TOSHI primes their warheads.

\<\< WE ARE NOT ALONE. >>

An anomaly in the local network. Something shifts in the darkness.
