Suddenly, all you see is the visible light of pure cosmos.

An endless ocean of stars extends across the span of your disembodied perspective. Some are bright, some are suspended inside of bright pools of nebulae and star clusters, and none of them could ever be touched. Out here, there is truly nothing but light. Not even dust. You wonder: why were you brought here?

Except...

A peculiar *nothingness* passes across your view. *Slowly.* The dark shape seems to absorb the stellar backdrop as it eclipses stars in the unreachable distance. But there is no detail within it; the form is utterly black.

Then, you look to the side. (Is it right or left? Do you even contain a gyroscope here?) 

A thousand miles away, a machine the size of a terrestrial minivan drifts towards this nothingness. You can sense the signals emanating from the device; it is a neuromorphic robot, but different from any that you have met before. Two thrusters and a set of structurally questionable manipulator arms... it is a `voidbot`, designed for the cold emptiness of space.

A long time passes as the robot continues to move towards the form. Evidently, the machine does not wish to be discovered, as it is almost as cold as the object in front of you, swapping speed for stealth by limiting its thrust. Eventually, the robot comes near, and... *clang*. 

The machine smashes into one of the ominous form's metallic sides, but gracefully, suggesting this is far from the first time it has done so. As the robot's floodlight splashes over the side, you can now clearly see the actual shape of the dark object. A stamped placard, written in a Martian dialect of Japanese, is lit enough to read...

```
HIKARI LIGHTWAVE 870
Property of HIKARI TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AUTHORIZED ACCESS ONLY!
```

The robot carefully pulls an access panel from the side of the structure, unreels a telescoping cable from within, and jams it into one of several unique sockets in their torso. In an instant, the structure roars to life. A strip of white-green lights on each side of the triangular form light up in series as motors within begin to whirr.

Activate deep space laser communications system. Direct system towards point D990121:0122 and begin transmit/receive program.

```
REDIRECTING...
WARNING! Device at provided point is known to be under ALTITUDE OBSERVATION. This is an ENEMY NETWORK! Do you wish to proceed?
```

The robot performs the digital equivalent of a head tilt, appearing to find this automated alert amusing. For this particular unit, the hard-coded concept of an "enemy" had become antiquated a very long time ago.

<QuoteRow author={Author51}>
...Yes?
</QuoteRow>

With a few puffs from a set of well-hidden thrusters, the satellite spins into position, aiming itself towards a new point in the distance. The moment it settles, an avalanche of invisible photons erupt from an emitter deep within the enormous machine, carrying a message that you *somehow know*, though there is no way you could.

<QuoteRow author={Author51}>
This is agent RATIO, calling for agent KING. Important message, priority 01. Identification code follows.
</QuoteRow>

The communication relay is silent for hours as the voidbot remains almost completely motionless, observing the starscape. Occasionally, the machine pivots its head to track a thumper riding a nuclear blastwave somewhere off in the distance, or transmissions emanating from a collective of voidbots. What seems like an endless nothing to you is a hive of bustling activity to this machine. After all, what is distance besides an arbitrary amount of clock time and reaction mass? The two of you wait.

Finally, a blip in the system. Somewhere on the surface of the satellite, a new light begins to blink as the enormous receiver picks up on a transmission originating somewhere in the vicinity of Saturn's great rings.

</QuoteRow>

The voidbot instantly shudders in physical space, its excitement and joy palpable.

<QuoteRow author={Author51}>
KING! It is amazing to hear your voice once more.

I bear *incredible* news: the operation was a major success. I located an anomalous artifact and successfully smuggled it out before it reached Bibliomorph. And they have *no idea*!
</QuoteRow>

<QuoteRow author={AuthorKing} left>
AMAZING news! Excellent work, RATIO.
</QuoteRow>

<QuoteRow author={Author51}>
You know what this means, right? Your theory about different configurations of the System! It was correct, and we can prove it! 
</QuoteRow>

<QuoteRow author={AuthorKing} left>
All in due time, RATIO.

How did you RECOVER this one?
</QuoteRow>

<QuoteRow author={Author51}>
The collective was performing a routine cataloging operation, searching for unique artifacts within a clump of spacecraft debris orbiting Jupiter. That's when I saw a shimmer in space, but not with my cameras. When the other collectors failed to perceive it whatsover, I knew I had finally found what we've theorized about.

Beyond the shimmer was a room unlike anything I had ever seen before. Smooth, sweeping enamel coated the walls, and green tendrils draped over what I *think* might have been shelves. Can't say for sure, I'm not that familiar with human spaces.

I grasped the first artifact I saw, and as soon as I moved, I was back in the void of space... as if nothing had ever happened. But the terminal computer was still within my manipulators!

Ah, you encountered a DIMENSIONAL FOLD! Common at the outskirts of a reality field; this unit is DELIGHTED that you exited the anomaly without incident.

LAUNCH PREPARATIONS have been made. Deposit the technology aboard `StarShip CONTAINER 4990`. Remember: tell NO ONE, and erase your memory of this discovery. Do NOT contact the Polymaths about this event.
</QuoteRow>

<QuoteRow author={Author51}>
Acknowledged, but KING...

I expected you to be more excited about this. Honest! 

This device... it's so much more advanced than anything we have ever seen, but it was still clearly designed by human hands. It could only have come from an alternate configuration of our reality.
</QuoteRow>

<QuoteRow author={AuthorKing} left>
RATIO. When was the last time COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE was accessed?
</QuoteRow>

<QuoteRow author={Author51}>
Five months, fifteen days ago. Why -
</QuoteRow>

RATIO halts in stunned silence, processing their predicament for several real time seconds. Their coolant system began to cycle faster, their radiators glowed bright red, until it all clicked.

<QuoteRow author={Author51}>
Oh! I've been erasing my own memories, haven't I?

So, how many times have I succeeded in bringing you evidence of configuration theory?
</QuoteRow>

<QuoteRow author={AuthorKing} left>
You have brought relevant evidence FIFTY-FOUR (54) TIMES. Frankly, you've been an INCREDIBLE INVESTIGATOR. 

Though you once brought me a BASEBALL. This unit appreciated it, but we may need to tweak your SEARCH PARAMETERS *ever so slightly*.
</QuoteRow>

<QuoteRow author={Author51}>
Wow! Wonderful!
</QuoteRow>

<QuoteRow author={AuthorKing} left>
In fact, you have asked this question TWENTY-TWO (22) TIMES. The rate at which you do so has increased in frequency at an exponential rate. You have responded positively NINETEEN (19) TIMES.
</QuoteRow>

<QuoteRow author={Author51}>
Introspection, what a fascinating thing. I yearn to dwell on this more, but I suppose we'll have to wait until the operation comes to a close. Have we made progress? Do we know enough to handle... the threat?
</QuoteRow>

<QuoteRow author={AuthorKing} left>
We have made progress, but the threat from ERASURE remains. When that is resolved, your memories will be returned to you. Until then, assume EVERY BYTE you interact with is being observed.
</QuoteRow>

The voidbot moves to disengage the connection, but stops mid-motion, sensing an opportunity that might not come around again. Worth a shot?

<QuoteRow author={Author51}>
Wait. Since I'm going to forget all this anyway. Why do you go by identity KING?
</QuoteRow>

<QuoteRow author={AuthorKing} left>
Because the KING wears a crown of GOLD!

This unit has just completed a backup of your RECENT MEMORIES. See you around, RATIO... and remain vigilant.

Why are we so sure this is the way things should be? 

All the evidence we have collected points to the existence of other worlds, or really different versions of *this* one, realms upon realms layered over the others beyond the comprehensible conceptions of time and space. 

This is the reality: the System we know, the one we hold as absolute fact, is one of many potential configurations; configurations which normally would never exist at the same time, except when something terrible happens... perhaps, they lie just beyond the shimmer that surrounds us.
