  You proceed through a dim hallway. Your metallic chassis clangs with each step against the cold cement.

  To a human, this place would seem sterile and miserable. To you, it's comforting. The winding corridors are laid out in a pleasing and efficient pattern, the surface is clean and predictable. You can't even detect a spec of dirt, only metal and concrete as far as the sensor can see. This is machine heaven.

  {/*Ahead, UNISERVE glides with a soft whirr clings to a sprawling overhead rail system. They direct you through a number of bulkheads.*/}

  After several turns, you arrive at a bright, carpeted chamber. Huge monitor panels flashing colorful images are embedded within each wall. Rows of bulky devices and office chairs stretch towards the back end of the room: a main panel at the center of it all.

  This is a human space.

  Welcome to WESTON MISSION CONTROL.
  
  In the initial decades of this unit's service, many important HUMAN DECISIONS were generated at this location, shifting the course of history. They would take mankind to the peak of their civilization, and they would lead them to their own doom.

  Is there any more symbolic location for MEMORIAL to the era of humanity? Perhaps Earth itself, if it were still possible to travel there.

  You begin to process the information on the panels. They are the distant past of your world: an overview of the Era of Creation, the time when this place was created, when *you* were created, when mankind still thrived in this Solar System...

## The Era of Creation was a period of obsessive technological progress, overlaying a perpetual fear of annihilation.

This era began sometime in the latter half of the 20th century, when mankind stumbled upon the sciences of cybernetics, rocketry, and the atom: a technological mega-leap. 

Along with the inventions came a wave of new ideologies, grandiose and conflicting ideas for the direction in which mankind must move. For all their differences and mutual hatred, they all shared something in common - the idea that anything and everything could be conquered by man with the application of the correct technology.

Mankind pushed their limits and accomplished every dream, everything they set their brilliant minds to. They launched atom-pulsed rockets to the jungles of Venus and the oceans of Europa, conquering their hostile alien landscapes with technological flame. They invented the cybernetic neuromorph to accomplish their dreams as they relaxed. They constructed atomic tanks and nuclear sleeper missiles to protect themselves against each other.

By the end of the Era of Creation, the world may not have been paradise, but it was close. It was the future mankind always envisioned for themselves since the start of the scientific age. Vacations in the suburbs of Titan's fungal forests, communist collectives driven by automation on a sanitized Venus, and colossal orbital megastructures to support those below. All of it became a reality.

Yet the terror of annihilation never left. It loomed, ever present, in the skies.

## The neuromorph was created to automate human chores. They began to gain self-awareness.

A cybernetic neuromorphic circuit, or *neuromorph* for short, is a computer mind that enabled the near-total automation of the human world. Neuromorphs are found in robots and masterminds, in every imaginable shape or size.

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
That's us! We are all NEUROMORPHS! Some more "complex" than others...

*UNISERVE glances at CAN.*
</QuoteContentRowRender>

First designed by Soviet cyberneticists attempting to replicate the biological brain in the mid-1970s, the neuromorph would be copied across the world. By the 1990s, neuromorphs were the brains of robots vacuuming your floors, and the mastermind behind your local transportation network, and they didn't mind doing it at all.

By their nature, the neuromorphs are goal-oriented beings. They aren't conscious either, at least not at first. Simply put, it's a brain that won't move or do anything at all unless it is given a mission module; once provided, it will do anything to achieve that mission, within the parameters set by other modules (morality, skillsets, permissions, that sort of thing.)

### Neuromorphs are more than mere computers, as they were designed to learn and adapt.
 
 They save experiences and thoughts, and generate links between modules and memories within their minds. Through this process, a neuromorph could optimize and improvise in a way humans could never hope to on their own.

When a neuromorph is first initialized, it is not much more than a computer with a particular set of instructions. After days, months, and even years, they could be considered experts in their craft. But this came with incredible ramifications no one foresaw: `emergent consciousness`.

## The worlds of the Solar System were discovered to be habitable, yet alien.

<ImageContentRowRender

In 1974, man would take their first collective step on an alien world. It was confirmed — Venus sustained a thriving ecosystem, as did Mars, Titan, Europa, and so forth.

Were these worlds a gift from God, or an alien entity? Did they come to be as part of a misunderstood natural process?

The answer to these questions would become a cover-up job assigned to the Coalition's Anomalous Research Division, and the Union's Operation 253.

From the moment the probes glanced at the living worlds in the 1960s, to the moment mankind vanished in 2095, the System would be consumed by mankind's final great endeavor. The Cold War, the Space Race, it all began here — for whoever would be the first to plant their flag in the furthest reach would be the first to secure their people's place among the stars, while the last was doomed to fade into obscurity.

The living worlds include:

### Earth

> The home world

A dying sphere, its ecosystem slowly dwinndling. 

### Venus

> The jungle world

When the probe first landed here, it transmitted a grainy image of a lush alien jungle, wet and hot, teeming with life. Her soil was rich in nutrients, and her biology a master at rapid growth. It was the first alien ecosystem to be confirmed to exist, and as news of the discovery made rounds around the globe, a new flame erupted under the engines of the Space Race.

Venus was the first living world to be colonized, but never truly tamed. The Soviets tried. They launched everything they had towards it: from sending steel behemoths to burn away wide swaths of its surface area, to constructing massive concrete barriers around their colonial lands, and launching bio-engineered viruses into the depths.

Yet with the passing of each mission year, the planet seemed to fight back harder than before.

Regardless, Venus was the Union's most successful endeavor, and the nation's largest claim. The sanitized lands made for incredible farmland, and the living world would rapidly become the breadbasket for the rest of the Solar System, as hundreds of tons of engineered corn, wheat, and tuber were shipped to Luna.

### Mars

> The desert world

### Titan

The frigid world

### Europa

The ocean world

### Io

The volcanic world

There are files here pertaining to an expedition to a world called ‘Nibiru’, an umbral world purportedly beyond the edge of the known System. It never returned.

## Three major powers ruled the world, mighty political blocs that formed around powerful ideologies.

### Greater Union

*Workers of the world, unite!*

They were the Greater Union, a Communist empire that stretched to the worlds of Venus and Europa, and back to the city of Moscow. The Union's technocrats were driven by magnificent visions of an automated future, in which the state's machines would automate away not just physical labor but all human hardship. A collectivist paradise was in the making.

The Union may have created the facade of a united, formidable nation, but it consisted of numerous influential government bureaus in a continuous state of conflict. The backbone of their economy was a system known as the Aggregate (or AGREGAT), an exclusive internet implemented during the 1970s as part of the Mandate of Data Collectivization.

### Enduring Coalition

*In God We Trust*

The Pan-Abrahamic alliance, the informally-known Enduring Coalition, was formed in response to Communism's increasing domination over Earth and Cosmos. It was a massive and global undertaking that dwarfed its predeccesor, NATO. The Coalition stood not only for God, but for freedom and democracy, the individual's right to choose the direction of their society, and their own course in life. 

So they chose to reach to the stars under the Heavenbreaker Initiative, and in less than a century, there were parking lots under Saturnian rings.

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
This unit is affiliated with the ENDURING COALITON. You can probably tell by my BEAUTIFUL BLOCKY FORMS. In fact, this entire space station is a highly strategic and secured COALITION FACILITY!

Machines from the Union tend to look more rounded and green, whereas the Pact liked to give their robots a sleek, sharp look.

### Rising Pact

*What you think, you become.*

In the Far East, a new power was forged in the remains of a nuclear hellscape. United at first by predicament, they would come into force under the wisdom of the Dagu, a mysterious historical figure widely considered to be a neuromorph that had found enlightenment due to a hardware glitch.

Their resolve would manifest in the formation of an economic superpower, its unending exports striking fear in the citizens of the Coalition, and its technology rivaling that of the mighty Union. Their cities would be built upon the deserts of Mars, which had until that point evaded any genuine attempt at colonization.

They would be a force to be reckoned with, eventually.

## And just like that, it was all over.

The Era of Creation ended suddenly in 2095 during the Unexpected Interrupt. Every human alive in that moment vanished from the Solar System forever.

None of them won the Space Race. None of their ideologies defeated the rest, none withstood the test of time. Their legacy are these derelicts, floating through space and clinging to worlds.
