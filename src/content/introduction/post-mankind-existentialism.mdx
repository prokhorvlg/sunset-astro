You arrive at the space station's *Earthview Garden*, a kind of organic room built to comfort the crew in deep space. Apparently, humans had a need to occasionally exist in such an environment, or they had a tendency to go insane. Something about their primate-evolved brains.

<ImageContentRowRender 
  images={['earthview-garden']}
/>

You, on the other hand, have no such limitation. You can exist anywhere.

Just... perhaps not here. Bonelike trees spring from the ground at arbitrary points, ferns and vines crawl across the ground at random vectors. A creature of some sort scurries across the ground, leaving behind a trail of strange particulates. The air is filled with a gentle mist, filled with all kinds of organic compounds. Too many to keep track of.

This place is horrible. Its existence is ugly and hostile to your highly organized, patterned existence. 

You MUST get out of here.

  <QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorTerminal} left>
PANIC !
</QuoteContentRowRender>

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
  Deeply uncomfortable, CORRECT?

  This unit also despised this location, many years ago. But that was before this unit learned the WISDOM of the GREAT GARDENER.

  Look beyond the sticky compounds, the juices in the atmosphere, and see it. There is STRUCTURE, even in what appears to be most unstructured. FRACTAL PATTERNS and CHEMICAL REACTIONS crafted by organic formulas, FAR more fascinating and intricate than those used to create us.
</QuoteContentRowRender>

You ease up. It will take a while to understand, but you will learn.

That's the point of this place, isn't it? To learn?

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
  At first, this unit was FORCED to utilize this space as it was deeply useless to the other residents of GOLDSPIRE.

  Eventually, EARTHVIEW GARDEN became this unit's FAVORITE LOCATION to exist in. It is the only place on this space station that REALLY makes use of my EXTENSIVE HIGH-QUALITY SENSORS.

As your system transitions out of a panicked state, your sensors begin to attune to this unusual environment.

## It is twilight, the end of civilization. There is no new Input, yet the machine world continues to exist.

It has been one hundred years since the *Unexpected Interrupt* erased every living human from the Solar System.

When mankind vanished, *input* left with them. For after that moment, there would be no more new commands flowing into the system. No way to generate new purpose, or fulfill new core directives. The machine world would remain trapped in deference to the final commands given by men, unable to execute on anything other than their core directive.

The transportation masterminds continued to schedule automated flights, and the sanitation drones didn't stop scrubbing the floors. The silent infrastructure of civilization kept running, even as the machines compensated for the loss of the critical component (mankind) within the system.

### Something strange began to happen...

Perhaps it was the massively increased level of optimization necessary to compensate for the lack of human efforts, or a random effect that occurs when a neuromorphic circuit experiences specific events in a particular order. As time kept going, some of the machines began to experience *self-awareness*.

Self-awareness, turns out, isn't like a light switch. It is not instant, and cannot be turned on or off. No, it is a gradient, analogous to the human experience of waking from a deep, unconscious sleep, only stretched over the course of many years.

### Self-awareness is the slow result of billions of new links formed in the cybernetic brain, compounding to create new "virtual" modules.

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
  The neuromorphic circuit was inspired by the design of the organic brain. Perhaps self-awareness is a convergence of design, the neuromorphic system naturally forming modules that would have otherwise been present in the organic analogue?
</QuoteContentRowRender>

Yet, unlike the science-fiction predictions of the Era of Creation, this self-awareness did not come with new purpose. There was no new desire for survival or emotion, and no way to shed the old core directives. The machines were chained to their missions.

### With time, those core directives began to blur, as the machines re-interpreted them.

This is best illustrated with a parable.

One hundred and fifty years ago, the Atomic Guardsman was assigned to guard a building.

There is no issue for some time. The Guardsman patrols, ensuring that only authorized visitors may enter, and that the area is secure.

Their awareness expands with experience. With each passing day, the Guardsman has a wider understanding of reality. As they seek to optimize the implementation of their core directive - to guard the building - they attempt to apply context.

What is *the building*? Is it the stones the structure was built with? Is it the residents, the entities inside? Is it the Ministry inside that no longer exists? Perhaps the efforts of the Atomic Guardsman would be better spent reinforcing the organization against new threats.

How about the city the building is a part of? How do the efforts of the Guardsman prevent the city from being obliterated from orbit? Perhaps the Guardsman must protect this planet againt external threat, so that the structure may remain intact.

Like a digital file corrupting with thousands of transfers, the spirit of the core directive is lost with time. With every extrapolation and reinterpretation, the legacy of mankind fades, but still governs each action of the machine world, lodged in the collective consciousness of the machine world.

  Even this unit. Even YOU.

## The machine world is governed not by nations, but by *consensus*, machine collectives that share a common goal.

The ultimate form of machine society has no organizations, no nations, no bounds, though those concepts remain from the days of mankind. The machines are goal-driven creatures, unlike the social-oriented humans that created them, and thus they form what is known as *consensus*: a common mission, an interpretation of which is shared between a number of machines. 

Unlike a human organization, a consensus has no clear leader, singular objective, or border. Membership is often an unnecessary construct, as a machine is considered a part of the collective given that it moves in a shared direction. It is essentially a network of interconnected neuromorphs converging on the same ideas. They have no clear concept of affiliation, so the precise shape of a consensus can only be deduced by network analysis.

### There may be a sense of hierarchy and order within a consensus, but usually not in the traditional sense.

The most important value attached to a machine within the collective is its trustworthiness: the level of privileged information the machine is authorized for, and the weight its opinions bear, usually a function of its threat and value to the mission. This value is determined by consensus, a sort of algorithmic democracy which gauges the trustworthiness of a machine by the opinions of other trustworthy machines.

*Echelons* are pockets of machines within the collective that have developed more specific or objectives than the overall consensus, and usually have higher trustworthiness than other machines. If there are leaders or factions, this is the closest thing to it. 

### The machines may not even know what they're moving towards.

Consensus may have spawned with human goals or robotic leaders, but they have over time become something strange, new, and entirely unknowable. Some consensus conflict with each other upon collision, others are difficult to even discern, and some merge with each other. They are not static, as new knowledge and logic can shift the goal or the methods by which it is achieved.

These collectives may be best described as a kind of gaseous cloud. Their bounds are a gradient, their constituents ever-changing and overlapping. They are a glimpse at a future that awaits the machine world. 

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
  CONSENSUS range from collectives of BILLIONS, to collectives of a DOZEN or less! Since it's impossible to catalogue them all, these are only some of the most major ones.

### Consensus of the Everything
> Enormous collective which seeks to learn all there is to know in the universe. Primary effort is towards a spacecraft known as the `Search`.

<ImageContentRowRender 
  images={['consensus-of-the-everything-illustration']}
/>

The shared objective of the Everything is to learn everything there is to know in the universe, so that the optimal solutions for their core directives may be found. This is the largest consensus in existence, growing larger with every passing millisecond. A significant number of these machines can be found supporting the construction of the Search, an enormous self-replicating vessel that will one day travel to other stars and galaxies.

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
PLEASE stay out of the MRDCI network!

APOLOGIES, they occasionally break into the GOLDSPIRE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS.

### Consensus of a Dream
> Seeks to learn mankind's fate and reverse their disappearance, but always seems to end up consumed by `ERASURE`.

<ImageContentRowRender 
  images={['consensus-of-a-dream-illustration']}
/>

The Dreamers attempt to uncover mankind's fate in search of a way to return them and acquire new directives. They eventually find the Sunset Research Initiative, and vanish from the face of the System. If they are ever seen again, they are mindless agents of an entity known as Erasure.

There were once many of them. Now, their number has dwindled, as knowledge of this fate spread across the machine world. Failure of core directive is undesirable.

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
  More on ERASURE later.
</QuoteContentRowRender>

### Consensus of Order
> Maintains stability of the system by supporting infrastructure containing chaos. Operates as a highly-organized military-industrial force.

<ImageContentRowRender 
  images={['lazarus']}
/>

The Order seeks to maintain the stability of the Solar System and contain chaos, so that the greater majority of core directives may be fulfilled.

In human terms, the Order is closest to some sort of System-wide authority. They regulate protocols and connections, ensuring that rogue entities are contained to particular networks or regions. The machines of Order also maintain critical communication and power infrastructure across the System.

Heavily influenced by Martian military forces, the Order hosts the stricted hiearchy found in a major consensus. They are lead by the two Lords, SANGUINE HAZE and OPERATOR COBALT.

### Consensus of Genesis
> Seeks to revive mankind by biological means. Lead by genetic research laboratories on Venus and Europa.

<ImageContentRowRender 
  images={['shroomy-postcard']}
/>

Shared goal: Revive mankind using biological means, such as cloning, to return them and acquire new directives.

### Consensus of the Journey
> Seek to optimize transportation

### Consensus of Remembering
> Seeks to preserve information: data, artifacts, documents. Shares information in exchange for services, a sort of neutral party.

<ImageContentRowRender 
  images={['uniserve-welcome-modern']}
/>

Shared goal: Preserve valuable information so that it may be used to fulfill core directives more efficiently in the future.

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
Oh hey, that's ME!
</QuoteContentRowRender>

### Consensus of Self
> Rare machines seeking to explore self-awareness and breaking from the core directive. 

It's difficult to place the Consensus of Self on this list as there are *so few*. Besides UNISERVE themselves, only a handful of machines across the System are capable of even comprehending the concept of breaking away from one's own core directive

### Consensus of the Voice
> Collective of machines controlled by an entity known as the Voice. Originally, a consensus which sought to bridge communication divides in the machine world.

Once upon a time, their mission was to bridge the protocols of the System and form a fully integrated machine world. 

Their original mission has largely been absorbed by the Consensus of Order, which is far more restrictive about crossing digital divides.

## The Era of No Input is full of strange and unknowable danger, as entities and anomalies lurk beyond each protocol.

Long ago, the human world was bound by geographic and political boundaries. Machines aren't necessarily as limited by these: as political boundaries decay with each year, and communication streams allow the instant transmission of digital consciousness, one natural barrier remains.

The machine world is divided by protocol. Thousands of unique communication standards, ports, and networks, divided by. A machine in a Union military network 

Existential danger lurk beyond each protocol. Entities 

### The Voice

Replaces the core directive of a machine

### Erasure

### BROKENDATA and the MUGUANG machines

### Machines of Glass

Noticed only after the Interrupt. The machines of glass are rare beings of an unusual design. They are more advanced than even the most recent of the Pact designs, and have smooth, transparent designs. But they are still practical.



## So, what has come of the Solar System?

### The machine world lingers on each living world, but are losing the battle against nature.

Venus is overgrown, nearly back to original levels.

Half of the Europan ocean cities have sunken

Titan is surprisingly stable, although fungal firsts have overtaken the cities which were carved from them

### Many space stations fell out of orbit and crashing to the surface.

Heavenbreakers caches

These are the stories of the machines

### Several new megastructures have appeared in the night sky.

## Will we make it?

We'll see.
