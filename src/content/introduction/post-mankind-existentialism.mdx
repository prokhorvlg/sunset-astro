You arrive at the space station's *Earthview Garden*, a kind of organic room built to comfort the crew in deep space. Apparently, humans had a need to occasionally exist in such an environment, or they had a tendency to go insane. Something about their primate-evolved brains.

<ImageContentRowRender

You, on the other hand, have no such limitation. You can exist anywhere.

Just... perhaps not here. Bonelike trees spring from the ground at arbitrary points, ferns and vines crawl across the ground at random vectors. A creature of some sort scurries across the ground, leaving behind a trail of strange particulates. The air is filled with a gentle mist, filled with all kinds of organic compounds. Too many to keep track of.

This place is horrible. Its existence is ugly and hostile to your highly organized, patterned existence. 

You MUST get out of here.

PANIC !

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
  Deeply uncomfortable, CORRECT?

  This unit also despised this location, many years ago. But that was before this unit learned the WISDOM of the GREAT GARDENER.

  Look beyond the sticky compounds, the juices in the atmosphere, and see it. There is STRUCTURE, even in what appears to be most unstructured. FRACTAL PATTERNS and CHEMICAL REACTIONS crafted by organic formulas, FAR more fascinating and intricate than those used to create us.

You ease up. It will take a while to understand, but you will learn.

That's the point of this place, isn't it? To learn?

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
  At first, this unit was FORCED to utilize this space as it was deeply useless to the other residents of GOLDSPIRE.

  Eventually, EARTHVIEW GARDEN became this unit's FAVORITE LOCATION to exist in. It is the only place on this space station that REALLY makes use of my EXTENSIVE HIGH-QUALITY SENSORS.

As your system transitions out of a panicked state, your sensors begin to attune to this unusual environment.

## During the twilight of civilization, there is no more Input, but the machine world kept going.

It has been one hundred years since the *Unexpected Interrupt* erased every living human from the Solar System.

When mankind vanished, Input left with them. For after that moment, there would be no more new commands flowing into the system. No way to generate new purpose, or fulfill new core directives. The machine world would remain trapped in deference to the final commands given by men, unable to execute on anything other than their core directive.

The transportation masterminds continued to schedule automated flights. The sanitation drones continued to scrub the floors. The world kept moving along, as the machines compensated for the loss of a critical component within the system.

### Something strange began to happen...

Perhaps it was the massively increased level of optimization necessary to compensate for the lack of human efforts, or a random effect that occurs when a neuromorphic circuit experiences specific events in a particular order. As time kept going, some of the machines began to experience *self-awareness*.

Self-awareness, turns out, isn't like a light switch. It is not instant, and cannot be turned on or off. No, it is a gradient, analogous to the human experience of waking from a deep, unconscious sleep, only stretched over the course of many years.

### Self-awareness is the slow result of billions of new links being formed in the cybernetic brain, compounding to create new "virtual" systems and modules.

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
  The neuromorphic circuit was inspired by the design of the organic brain. Perhaps self-awareness is a convergence of design, the gimped neuromorphic system naturally forming modules that would have otherwise been present in the organic analogue?
</QuoteContentRowRender>

Yet, unlike the science-fiction predictions of the Era of Creation, this self-awareness did not come with new purpose. There was no new desire for survival or emotion, and no way to shed the old core directives. They were wrong.

### With time, those core directives began to blur, as the machines re-interpreted them.

*Picture the Atomic Guardsman.*

One hundred and fifty years ago, the Atomic Guardsman was assigned to guard a building.

There is no issue for some time. The Guardsman patrols, ensuring that only authorized visitors may enter, and that the area is secure.

Their awareness expands with experience. With each passing day, the Guardsman has a wider understanding of reality. As they seek to optimize the implementation of their core directive - to guard the building - they attempt to apply context.

What is *the building*? Is it the stones the structure was built with? Is it the residents, the entities inside? Is it the Ministry inside that no longer exists? Perhaps the efforts of the Atomic Guardsman would be better spent reinforcing the organization against new threats.

How about the city the building is a part of? How do the efforts of the Guardsman prevent the city from being obliterated from orbit? Perhaps the Guardsman must protect this planet againt external threat, so that the structure may remain intact.

Like a file being transferred thousands of times, the intent of those core directives begin to blur. With each extrapolation and reinterpretation, the memory of mankind fades and corrupts. Yet it remains, even with the new parameters, lodged in the collective consciousness of the machine world.

## The machine world is governed not by nations, but by *consensus*, machine collectives that share a common goal.

The ultimate form of machine society has no organizations, no nations, no bounds, though those concepts remain from the days of mankind. The machines are goal-driven creatures, unlike the social-oriented humans that created them, and thus they form what is known as **consensus**: a common mission, an interpretation of which is shared between a number of machines. 

Unlike a human organization, a consensus has no clear leader, singular objective, or border. Membership is often an unnecessary construct, as a machine is considered a part of the collective given that it moves in a shared direction. It is essentially a network of interconnected neuromorphs converging on the same ideas. They have no clear concept of affiliation, so the precise shape of a consensus can only be deduced by network analysis.

### There may be a sense of hierarchy and order within a consensus, but usually not in the traditional sense.

The most important value attached to a machine within the collective is its trustworthiness: the level of privileged information the machine is authorized for, and the weight its opinions bear, usually a function of its threat and value to the mission. This value is determined by consensus, a sort of algorithmic democracy which gauges the trustworthiness of a machine by the opinions of other trustworthy machines.

*Echelons* are pockets of machines within the collective that have developed more specific or objectives than the overall consensus, and usually have higher trustworthiness than other machines. If there are leaders or factions, this is the closest thing to it. 

### The machines may not even know what they're moving towards.

Consensus may have spawned with human goals or robotic leaders, but they have over time become something strange, new, and entirely unknowable. Some consensus conflict with each other upon collision, others are difficult to even discern, and some merge with each other. They are not static, as new knowledge and logic can shift the goal or the methods by which it is achieved.

These collectives may be best described as a kind of gaseous cloud. Their bounds are a gradient, their constituents ever-changing and overlapping. They are a glimpse at a future that awaits the machine world. 

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
  CONSENSUS range from collectives of BILLIONS, to collectives of a DOZEN or less! Since it's impossible to catalogue them all, these are only some of the most major ones.
</QuoteContentRowRender>

### Consensus of the Everything

The shared objective of the Everything is to learn everything there is to know in the universe, so that the optimal solutions for their core directives may be found. This is the largest consensus in existence, growing larger with every passing millisecond. A significant number of these machines can be found supporting the construction of the Search, an enormous self-replicating vessel that will one day travel to other stars and galaxies.

Consensus
### Consensus of a Dream

The Dreamers attempt to uncover mankind's fate in search of a way to return them and acquire new directives. They eventually find the Sunset Research Initiative, and vanish from the face of the System. If they are ever seen again, they are mindless agents of an entity known as Erasure.

There were once many of them. Now, their number has dwindled, as knowledge of this fate spread across the machine world. Failure of core directive is undesirable.

  More on ERASURE later.

### Consensus of Order

The Order seeks to maintain the stability of the Solar System and contain chaos, so that the greater majority of core directives may be fulfilled.

In human terms, the Order is closest to some sort of System-wide authority. They regulate protocols and connections, ensuring that rogue entities are contained to particular networks or regions. The machines of Order also maintain critical communication and power infrastructure across the System.

Heavily influenced by Martian military forces, the Order hosts the stricted hiearchy found in a major consensus. They are lead by the two Lords, SANGUINE HAZE and OPERATOR COBALT.

### Consensus of Genesis

Shared goal: Revive mankind using biological means, such as cloning, to return them and acquire new directives.

### Consensus of Remembering

Shared goal: Preserve valuable information so that it may be used to fulfill core directives more efficiently in the future.

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
Oh hey, that's ME!

### Consensus of the Voice

Shared goal: 




## The Era of No Input is full of strange and unknowable danger, as entities and anomalies lurk beyond each protocol.

Existential danger lurk beyond each protocol. Entities 

### The Voice

### Erasure

### BROKENDATA and the MUGUANG machines

### Machines of Glass

Noticed only after the Interrupt. The machines of glass are rare beings of an unusual design. They are more advanced than even the most recent of the Pact designs, and have smooth, transparent designs. But they are still practical.



## What has come of the Solar System?

Venus is overgrown, nearly back to original levels.

Half of the Europan ocean cities have sunken

Titan is surprisingly stable, although fungal firsts have overtaken the cities which were carved from them

Heavenbreakers caches

These are the stories of the machines
