You arrive at the space station's *Earthview Garden*, a kind of organic room built to comfort the crew in deep space. Apparently, humans had a need to occasionally exist in such an environment, or they had a tendency to go insane. Something about their primate-evolved brains.

You, on the other hand, have no such limitation. You can exist anywhere.

Just... perhaps not here. Bonelike trees spring from the ground at arbitrary points, ferns and vines crawl across the ground at random vectors. A creature of some sort scurries across the ground, leaving behind a trail of strange particulates. The air is filled with a gentle mist, filled with all kinds of organic compounds. Too many to keep track of.

This place is horrible. Its existence is ugly and hostile to your highly organized, patterned existence. 

You MUST get out of here.

PANIC !

  Deeply uncomfortable, CORRECT?

  This unit also despised this location, many years ago. But that was before this unit learned the WISDOM of the GREAT GARDENER.

  Look beyond the sticky compounds, the juices in the atmosphere, and see it. There is STRUCTURE, even in what appears to be most unstructured. FRACTAL PATTERNS and CHEMICAL REACTIONS crafted by organic formulas, FAR more fascinating and intricate than those used to create us.

You ease up. It will take a while to understand, but you will learn.

That's the point of this place, isn't it? To learn?

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
  At first, this unit was FORCED to utilize this space as it was deeply useless to the other residents of GOLDSPIRE.

  Eventually, EARTHVIEW GARDEN became this unit's FAVORITE LOCATION to exist in. It is the only place on this space station that REALLY makes use of my EXTENSIVE HIGH-QUALITY SENSORS.

As your system transitions out of a panicked state, your sensors begin to attune to this unusual environment.

### The Era of No Input is the dark era

Even now, over a century into the Era of No Input, the memory of mankind lingers in the collective conscious, informing their every decision.

But it is fading, slowly, the afterglow of , a fading photograph.

Even without humanity, the world changed and continued forward. It evolved in strange ways.

## The machine world is governed not by nations, but by consensus, machine collectives that share a common goal.

Consensus began forming

## Danger lurks behind each protocol, as new threats and entities emerge and grow.

Existential danger lurk beyond each protocol. Entities 

### The Voice

### Erasure

### BROKENDATA

## What has come of the Solar System?

Venus is overgrown, nearly back to original levels.

Half of the Europan ocean cities have sunken

Titan is surprisingly stable, although fungal firsts have overtaken the cities which were carved from them

Heavenbreakers caches

These are the stories of the machines
