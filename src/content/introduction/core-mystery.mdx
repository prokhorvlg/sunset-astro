You are lead through an airlock into an airless corridor. It is deep in the guts of the station, far from prying eyes.

  I have made deals to get this information.

  Someone does not want any of us to know this.

You approach a computer terminal in the middle of a dark chamber. It is very similar to but not quite like the others. A bright orange-and-red symbol on the screen blinds your sensors.

## Noetics is a metaphysical science that defies all known understanding of reality.

In 1990f4 a strange science was discovered, weird artifacts, etc

## The Sunset Research Initiative was created to find a technological solution to human conflict.

The year was 2056. The hate and fear has festered and only grown in the last century, manifesting into the latest decade-long “near midnight” scenario: the terrors of

The nations of the world came together to form the enigmatic Sunset Research Initiative, promising to put a technological end to human conflict and prevent inevitable annihilation. Their efforts, shrouded in mystery to the rest of the System, led to the Unexpected Interrupt, the moment in which mankind vanished, leaving behind only the machines.

### 

*Created for the sake of saving mankind from inevitable nuclear armageddon, the Sunset Research Initiative (or SRI) was a multinational scientific with created with extreme secrecy.*

Formed in the late 2050s, the Sunset Research Initiative was a system-wide effort to prevent nuclear annihilation by solving the problem of human conflict. 

The Initiative was divided into a number

Noetics

Dreamers

Projects

The Initiative hosted a number of projects

Propelled by the full resources of the world, the Initiative grew to a massive size - yet no individual department ever knew the entire scope of the organization.

Most of the Initiative would be concentrated on the Projects: individual Altars. Famously, Project 

There are currently a number of Projects described

## Ironically, by seeking to prevent one doomsday, they caused another.

### On May 7, 2095, mankind vanished. This would come to be known as the Unexpected Interrupt.

*May 7 2095, 19:32:05 GMT, Earthtime: it was the moment mankind vanished from reality.*

Before this moment, the Solar System was a bustling hive. Afterwards, it was a silent wind. The machine world would come to know this moment as the Unexpected Interrupt, the instant after which new orders from the creators ceased to be entered. The transition point between the Era of Creation, and the Era of No Input.

At large, the machine world has no knowledge of what caused the event. Any machine that attempts to investigate the disappearance eventually ends up with their memory erased and their will subverted. It is typically surmised that the event has something to do with the Sunset Research Initiative.
