All that is known is that it involved the Sunset Research Initiative, an international science program aimed towards solving human conflict."

Your journey through the human spaces of the space station comes to an end as as UNISERVE glides into a service corridor, hidden from the hallway. Several twists and turns later, and you arrive at a heavy metal ring labelled `STORAGE HOLD 5 - WEAR APPROPRIATE EQUIPMENT WHEN ENTERING`. 

This is the point of separation between the spacious human-habitated ring, and microgravity of the central infrastructural ring.

  Before we proceed, you must be MADE AWARE. What you are about to see may place you in a state of DANGER.

  There is an entity, out there, which does not wish us to know. It has made acquiring relevant ARTIFACTS rather difficult.

  Are you still interested?

  <QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorTerminal} left>
CERTAINLY.

The ring unseals and rolls away with a heavy mechanical groan. You end inside an even more complex web of passages, deep in the guts of the station and far from prying eyes. The walls are lined with storage units and various panels. Doesn't look like anything special, though.

A cascade of bizarre codes storm your sensory input before fading away. Several of the panels in the cargo hold are now inscribed with a bright orange-red symbol. You propell yourself towards the first one.

## The first prediction engines estimated the end of human society within one hundred years.

It was a secret for some time, but as more prediction engines were constructed over the 1990s, there was no more denying the truth. According to these machines, society was converging on doomsday: a technological cataclysm that would end the world as mankind knew it. 

Despite the fears and outcries, nothing changed. The great powers of Earth continued to colonize the living worlds, all the while positioning "sleeper" missiles into cold orbits and asteroid belts, massively destructive weapon systems that could annihilate entire continents and orbital stations within just a few hours of cold launch.

In 2056, hate had festered into open hostility once again. The Union and Coalition began to clash over the strategic positioning of their atom-powered spacecraft for at least the third time in recent history. Sabotaged orbits lead to anger, and military posturing resulted in outright gunfire between fully-automated units. To many, this looked like the one. The midnight scenario was about to be reached, and life in the Solar System would cease to exist.

But just before the crisis reached its climax, something had changed in the political structures of their governments. As the disputed missiles returned to their respective space, officials from the Greater Union, Enduring Coalition, and Rising Pact came together to sign the *Charter for the Sunset Research Initiative*.

It was the year 2059, and the age of SRI had begun. 

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
Strongly suspect this is related to political influence of Union's OPERATION 253 and Coalition's ANOMALOUS RESEARCH DIVISION, which were folded into the Initiative upon formation.

## The Sunset Research Initiative was formed to prevent the apocalypse, by discovering a technological solution to conflict.

For there was no way the Greater Union would give up their nuclear devices, nor a way that the Coalition would stand down their atom-powered military. No, the world would use technology to solve this issue, like they had solved every issue in the past.

<ImageContentRowRender

The efforts of the Initiative were shrouded in mystery to the rest of the world. Their SCI security protocol ensured that the scientists could work in peace, removed from the petty politics of the world, and free to make discoveries that would terrify the people of Earth more than the nuclear bombs ever did. Mankind would be made to trust them.

And make discoveries they did.

## The nooscope allowed researchers to peer into a world beyond the physical. They observed consciousness itself.

The device was first invented long before the Initiative existed, by *Operation 253* - an old division of the Soviet interplanetary military. How this expeditionary force managed to create such a device baffles us, but needless to say, the existence of this device raised many concerns in Communist leadership. What did it prove? Apparently, the soul might be real? To what end?

The discoveries they made and the knowledge of the nooscope were buried. Operation 253 was not. In secret, they enhanced the nooscope until it could see thoughts and subconscious desire itself, and peered into what they called the noosphere, reality's sphere of conscious thought. When the organization became a part of the Initiative under the Charter, the nooscope was a foundational technology, a logical starting point for whatever came next.

Over the course of the next several decades, SRI would find uses for the nooscope that the rest of mankind would only dream of. Electronic locks, imprinted upon the conscious pattern of the mind. Infallible security screenings. And of course, most importantly, understanding of mankind's deepest desires.

## Noetics would be their tool: a metaphysical science that defies all known understanding of reality.

While agents of Operation 253 were parading their discoveries on Venus, their Western counterpart was uncovering an equally unsettling truth about reality. Something fundamentally earth-shattering, so total in its implications that it was similarly buried by their respective leadership.

In the late 1980s, MRDCI's *Anomalous Research Division* performed a number of clandestine studies on several human subjects. Their experiments sought to discredit the notion that the human mind had a tangible effect on reality, but to their shock, they had just proven the opposite. Using modified versions of the techniques already used by the covert agency, such as hypnotherapy, sensory deprivation, and specialized pharmacenuticals, researchers at ARD managed to manifest molecule-scaled changes in reality by implanting a thought in the patient's minds.

### They named this effect *noesis*, and the field *noetics*.

It wasn't until much later that the field of study was unified with the discoveries of Operation 253, and became the foundation for the Sunset Research Initiative.

<QuoteContentRowRender author={AuthorUniserve} >
If CONSCIOUS THOUGHT is a tangible force that exists outside of PHYSICAL REALITY, what is PHYSICAL REALITY? Is it shaped by, or even manifested by the collective?

This was what the Sunset Research Initiative was trying to figure out.

## Their research led to the construction of the Altars - massive, world-altering machines.

<ImageContentRowRender

At the time of writing, these are the known Projects.

* Project SVAROG
* Project DEEP SYNE
* Project MUGUANG
* Project ???
* Project WHITE SERAPH

### The Initiative had five Program Directors over the course of its 36-year-long existence.

But only three of them are known at the time of writing.

* `Eugene Goff` served from the moment the Initiative was founded, until the day he was removed by the Representatives in 2068. Goff was the mastermind behind the Altars.
* `Alexander Olson` was promoted from the Noetic Imaging Solutions Team and served until 2072.
* `UNKNOWN`
* `UNKNOWN`, likely responsible for several of the Black Projects about which little is known.
* `Jane Davis` headed the Initiative until the Unexpected Interrupt in 2095. They brought WHITE SERAPH to its completion.

## By seeking to prevent one doomsday, they caused another.

### On May 7, 2095, mankind vanished. This would come to be known as the Unexpected Interrupt.

*May 7 2095, 19:32:05 GMT, Earthtime: it was the moment mankind vanished from reality.*

Before this moment, the Solar System was a bustling hive. Afterwards, it was a silent wind. The machine world would come to know this moment as the Unexpected Interrupt, the instant after which new orders from the creators ceased to be entered. The transition point between the Era of Creation, and the Era of No Input.

At large, the machine world has no knowledge of what caused the event. Any machine that attempts to investigate the disappearance eventually ends up with their memory erased and their will subverted. It is typically surmised that the event has something to do with the Sunset Research Initiative.







They learned to construct a machine, a NEUROMORPH much like ourselves, far more capable than even a billion human minds.
