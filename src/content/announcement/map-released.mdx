Alien worlds colonized by the powers of old, slowly being reclaimed by nature. Interfacers trying to play cards in creaky space stations, teetering on the edge of falling from orbit. Mysterious noetic fields altering reality in ways that cannot be measured or reasonably explained (is Sunset System just another dimensional fold within a noetic anomaly?). Strange constructs built by the machine consensus' in the wake of mankind's disappearance, interpreting humanity's final commands in increasingly bizarre ways. The Solar System is much more vast and unknowable than anyone would think, but there are places a machine can call home.

The majority of the locations on the map also have extended descriptions, so be sure to read up on those.

*I'd love to hear your thoughts and your questions. There's a lot of new lore here, and frankly I don't want it to go missed.*

*If there's enough interest, I'd love to continue to explore the surfaces of the living worlds in future iterations of the map. Or maybe expand on SRI's story, or some of the consensus? Let me know what you want to see in the coming year!*
