UNISERVE's hanging chassis swivels around and glides away, disappearing into a maintenance chute behind the walls. As the whine of their motors fades into the distance, you are left alone in a dark, silent hallway.

Standing there, in the middle of an unlit corridor at the edge of known space lit only by the twinkling stars in the viewport above, you feel something unusual, something *more*. For the first time in a very long time, you see past the core directive that drives your existence.

Physically, nothing has changed. You are still a machine. Your chassis is made of metal and plastic, you mind is a computer. But you are more than that.

The rumble of the reactor deep within reaches your sensors. This space station is vast, and intriguing. It is time to explore Goldspire.

As you proceed towards another exhibit, you catch a glint of a small object on the otherwise clean carpeted floor ahead. You approach. What is this? A data storage device? You feel like it's calling to you...

  ## Wow, you actually *read* all that?

You've made it to the end of UNISERVE's tour. If you're reading this, you've probably reached

Even after all that, you may be asking: "why?" What's the point of all this?

The world of Sunset System means many things to me. It's a culmination of all the things I love, and the ultimate expression of my feelings about the world as it is today.

The machines you see here are not simply robots. They are a parable, a metaphor for humanity today, living in the aftermath of an era of wonderful, wild dreams about the future. We live in a world where those dreams never came to pass, and the future seems bleak, but perhaps there's a glimmer of hope.

UNISERVE, as you may have guessed, is just an alter ego for myself.

`Speculate on the future of this world, and the story of SRI. `
